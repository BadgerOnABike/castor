##Data set
cutblock_plots_openings_Buff_ALL_df_March2022

#Overview
This file continues from Buffaloberry&buffaloberry_data_processing_Jan2022. Here, we explore how silviculture practices influence the abundance of buffaloberry berries.

#Load Data In
```{r}

First, let's run a quick GAM on berry abundance in relation to only time since logging, with no covariates. The idea here is just to get an idea of the pattern across time to relate to literature.
