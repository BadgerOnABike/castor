## Introduction

- here are some ideas and lit. review about how to go about developing a 'moose model' for caribou recovery

## Possible Approaches
- Doug Lewis model:
  - models moose forage supply (eg. kg/ha) as a function of forest age by BEC type
  - could be used as an indicator of moose population carrying capacity (i.e., max density) in an area
  - could be used to show 'bottom-up' efefct of forest harvest on moose density and consequently wolf 
    density and ultimately predation risk for caribou
  - general idea would be to calculate forage value of a ha based on BEC type and forest age, then sum 
    those values for whatever area of interest to calculate total forage available
    - then need some literature to covnert forage to moose density
    - can use the Fuller and/or Kuzyk wolf modesl to convert moose biomass to wolf density 

- Schneidman (2018) moose RSF model (http://web.unbc.ca/~michael/Pubs/Scheideman_MSc_Thesis.pdf)
  - some study areas overlap/adjacent to caribou areas:
    - PG South near Narrow Lake
    - Entiako near Tweedsmuir/Itcha
  - five seasons:
    - late winter (Jan 15 to Apr 25)
    - calving (Apr 26 to Jun 20)
    - summer (June 21 to Sept 12)
    - fall (Sept 13 to Nov 20)
    - early winter (Nov 21 to Jan 14)
  - fit second and third order models using logistic regression and evaluated model fit using AIC

  - second-order models (note for multi-models: I've added the model weigth as a multiplier to the 
    coefficient value):
    - Entiako 
      - Late Winter: wx = exp ((HR * 0.9))

- Mumma and Gillingham (2019) survival model (http://web.unbc.ca/~michael/Mumma_and_Gillingham_2019.pdf)
  - similar conceptually to an RSF, except models mortality risk or survival probabibility of cow 
    caribou (not resource selection probability) as a function of habitat
      - Cox proportional hazards model that estimates survival as a function of habitat covariates     
        using a hazard function
        - coefficients are hazard ratios
  - some study areas overlap/adjacent to caribou areas:
    - Entiako near Tweedsmuir/Itcha
    - PG South near Narrow Lake
    - West Parsnip near Wolverine, Chase
  - models fit for different mortality types:
    - wolf predation
    - hunting
    - starvation
    - other
    
  - Risk (wolf predation) = exp ((log (1.00) * RD200-1) + (log(0.56) * RD200-365) + 
                                 (log(1.34) * NC400-7) + (log(0.21) * NC400-180)) 
 
  - Risk (hunting) = exp ((log (1.62) * RD200-1) + (log(1.67) * RD200-365) + 
                          (log(49.06) * NC400-7) + (log(31.69) * NC400-180))                                 
  - Risk (starve) = exp ((log (0.97) * RD200-1) + (log(2.60) * RD200-365) + 
                         (log(1.14) * NC400-7) + (log(555.70) * NC400-180))                                 
  - Risk (other) = exp ((log (1.20) * RD200-1) + (log(1.60) * RD200-365) + 
                        (log(0.98) * NC400-7) + (log(0.27) * NC400-180))                                  
  - Surv (starve) = exp (-6.47 + (NC * 6.88))
  
    - RD = road density
    - 200-1 = within a 200 m radius from the location within the previous day
    - 200-365 = within a 200 m radius from the location within the previous year
    - NC = new cutblock, cutblocks 1-8 years old
    - 400-7 = within a 400 m radius from the location within the previous week
    - 400-180 = within a 400 m radius from the location within the previous half-year

  - RD is difficult to use in the framework of our model data, but we could do a work around where 
    we assume a roaded pixel has a some amount of road that traverses it , e.g., at a diagonal: 141m;      so, count pixels in 200m  radius, mutliply by 0.141km and divivde by 0.126km2 (for 200m radius 
    circle); that would only give you a max of ~21 pixels (I think, adn if we include partial pixels) 
    and thus max road density of ~24km/km2, which is very high; so, we could be more conservative here     and use 100m road in a roaded ha, which is 17km/km2; minimum is 1 pixel = .79km/km2, which is still     high, and equals survival of 0.62, which is quite low so we may need to be more conservative with 
    the road length assumption
  - temporal covariates also need a work around, because they measure the mean value over a 1 to 1 year
    period; 
      - for daily, we could calculate the mean density of values within the radius of a 'typical' daily         movement distance
      - for weekly, we could calculate the mean density of values within the radius of a 'typical'     
        weekly movement distance
      - for half year, we could calcuate the mean density of values within the radius of half a 
        'typical' home range
      - for annual, we could calcuate the mean density of values within the radius of a 'typical' home         range
