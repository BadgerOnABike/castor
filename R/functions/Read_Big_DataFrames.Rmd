Reading a large CSV file without loading it all into memory.

If you have limited RAM, using a flat file data frame (ffdf) 
allows the creation of an R object that doesn't take up  
a lot of RAM.

My problem was reading Provincial Tipsy output and subsetting by features in a TSA.

```{r}

# required libraries
library(RPostgreSQL)

# tuning parameters may be required depending on the OS
# these options requried or ERROR: NAs introduced by coercion to integer
# when subsetting
options(ffbatchbytes = 84882227)
options(ffmaxbytes = 3143106560)

library(ff)
library(ffbase)


# connect to PostgreSQl
drv <- dbDriver("PostgreSQL")
con <- dbConnect(drv, dbname='results_2018')

# select feature_id where it is in tsa number 16
r0 <- dbSendQuery(con,"select feature_id from tsa where tsa_no = 16")
features <- fetch(r0,n=-1)

# this file has 3 million rows and is 2.2GB in size.
# reading this via read.csv can take over 10GB of RAM?
# don't ask me why
bigFile <- "C:/Data/projects/resultsDelivery/v_2018/Tipsy/agg_nat_fid_out.csv"

# start by reading 1 row with the header to get column information
headset <- read.csv(bigFile, header = TRUE, nrows = 1)

#return the column name and type
headclasses <- sapply(headset, class)

print(Sys.time())

# read using read.csv.ffdf and supply column information via colClasses 

# may need some tuning paraeters:

#bigData = read.csv.ffdf(file=bigFile, first.rows=5000, colClasses=headclasses)
#bigData <- read.csv.ffdf(file=bigFile, next.rows = 100000,colClasses=headclasses)
bigData <- read.csv.ffdf(file=bigFile,colClasses=headclasses)

print(Sys.time())
# can now subset into a regular data frame (or table) 
# without flooding RAM
smallData <- as.data.frame(bigData[ffwhich(bigData,bigData$Identifier %in% features$feature_id),])
print(Sys.time())

# an alternative is to use read.csv.sql which uses the SQLite pacakge
# did not test this as there seems to be package problems with blob?
