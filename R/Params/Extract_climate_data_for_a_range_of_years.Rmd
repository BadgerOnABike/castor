## Extract Climate Data

In this script you can extract climate data for a range of dates. I tried to get it to work with asci files but I could not get that to go properly. Annoying because I could then have deleted all the unneccessary climate variables and only have been left with the ones I wanted. I should maybe put more effort into fixing this sometime. 
```{r cars}
library(foreach)
library(snow)
library(parallel)
library(doParallel)
nCores<-2 # set this to the number of cores you want to use.
cl <- makeCluster(nCores, type="SOCK") # type SOCK is a socket connection. If MPI is available use "MPI". Note declaring this type is not needed with the parallel package
registerDoParallel(cl)#requires this

#setwd("D:/Climatebc_v730"); # set the ClimateBC root directory as the working directory
setwd("C:/Data/localApps/Climatebc_v730")

foreach (i=1980:1984) %dopar% {
   inputFile <- as.character("/C:\\Users\\klochhea\\castor\\R\\Paramsbc_dem_frt_Kyle.csv")
   outputFile = paste0('/C:\\Users\\klochhea\\castor\\R\\test\bc_',i , '.csv')
   system2("C:/Data/localApps/Climatebc_v730/ClimateBC_v7.30.exe",args= c('/M', paste0('/Year_', i, '.ann'), inputFile, outputFile))
 }
stopCluster(cl) #parallel package
 
```
