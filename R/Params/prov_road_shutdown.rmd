# Overview

In this document - a "no road development"" layer is created. These areas will remove nodes from the roadCLUS graph. These areas are in addition to the no road areas that include lakes or major waterbodies where the simulation of roading is beyond the type of road modelled.

# UWR orders for management of roads

#u-9-002 NO ROADS - these are high elevation winter range area with no harvesting
