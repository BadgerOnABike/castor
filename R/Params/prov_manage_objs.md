Create a forest management objective raster(s) based on two categories: i) harvesting systems and ii) zonal objectives.The various management objectives being considered and sources include:

Table: Zonal Objectives

|objective            |
|:--------------------|
|Old Growth Retention |



Table: Harvesting System Objectives

|objective            |
|:--------------------|
|Old Growth Retention |

Note: these management objectives are not inclusive of all objectives - but rather they are a set of major constraints considered in timber supply review.

## Steps
The steps in this process involve:
1. cleaning the landscape units
