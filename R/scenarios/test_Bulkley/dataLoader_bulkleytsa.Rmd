# Overview

The dataloaderCLUS preps the database and other objects required to run CLUS. A SQLite database is stored in memory called clusdb. This database can be saved to file using `save_clusdb = TRUE` or an existing clusdb can be used by specifying the path with `useCLUSdb = ".../clusdb.sqlite"`.

Here I set the parameters to create a database for the [Bulkley timber supply area (TSA)](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/forestry/managing-our-forest-resources/timber-supply-review-and-allowable-annual-cut/allowable-annual-cut-timber-supply-areas/bulkley-tsa)). 

The TSA is located in west-central British Columbia, encompasses approximately 736,000 hectares of land. It overlaps with the Telkwa caribou herds. 

The Bulkley TSAâ€™s allowable annual cut (AAC) is 852,000 cubic metres, effective January 29, 2014.

# Usage
Set parameters for creating the database in the code chunk below. 
```{r module_usage}

# Dependendices

First need an area of interest.
+nameBoundaryFile <- the vector data of the areas to consider. Defaults to caribou herd boundaries.
+nameBoundary<-The specific area of interest
+nameBoundaryColumn<-The column in the nameBoundaryFile that support the query for the area of interest
+nameBoundaryGeom<-the geometry column from which to run the spatial query containing the area of interest

The remaining files are:
+nameCompartmentRaster<- a provincial raster of compartments -- also known as supply blocks. Defaults to 1 compartment
+nameZoneRaster<-a provincial raster of management zones. Defaluts to 1 zone
+nameYieldRaster<-a provincial raster of id's that support a look up to yield tables. Defaults to 1 yield table
+nameAgeRaster<- a provincial raster of age. This can be set to zero, if correctly used to look up yields and constraints. Defaults to an age of 120
+nameCrownClosureRaster<- a provincial raster of crown closure. Used for management constraints. Defaults to 0 crown closure
+nameMaskHarvestLandbaseRaster<- a provincial raster of the timber harvesting landbase (THLB) that delinates area feasible to harvest timber. Defaults to all of the area of interest being eligible for harvesting.

# Events

The module only has an inititialization event for connecting to a database and establishing database objects


## Output data

The outputs contain the database connection object, functions needed to generate queries and the boundary and bounding box of the boundary needed for other queries

# Links to other modules

Links to every module required by CLUS
