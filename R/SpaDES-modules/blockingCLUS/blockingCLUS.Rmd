# Purpose

This module groups pixels together to form harvest units. The purpose of this process is to specfiy the distribution of patches formed through forestry activities. For a greater description of this process and the calibration of this module go [here](https://github.com/bcgov/clus/blob/master/reports/harvest/draft-CLUS-blocking.md) 

# Overview

The blockingCLUS module has two types of blocking algorithums:

1. `pre` blocking which uses a graph based image segmentation approach
2. `dynamic` blocking which uses the concept of contagion spreading

The module sets and updates the blocks table within `clusdb`. It requires - dataLoaderCLUS and growingStockCLUS to provide inputs.

# Usage

# Events

There are two methods used in blockingCLUS under the blockMethod parameter:

1. pre blocking ('pre') - aggregates pixels at one time step using a graph based segementation approach

2. dynamic blocking ('dynamic')  - aggregates pixels at multiple steps using a contagion approach

# Data dependencies

## Input data

A SQLite db is required as an output from dataloaderCLUS.

## Output data

A raster of block IDs, internally stored in memory in clusdb

# Links to other modules

dataloaderCLUS is required.
