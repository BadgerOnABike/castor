## forestryCLUS 

### What it does

forestryCLUS is nothing more than a convenient calculator for massive calculations. 
It should be used to explore possible futures - to identify where and where not to go, explore the consequences of policy and test sensitivity. 
It was designed to provide rapid feeback - for exploring the solution space. 

### Scope


forestryCLUS is meant to explore the forestry-caribou system where policy shocks on the forestry side would produce down stream effects on caribou
