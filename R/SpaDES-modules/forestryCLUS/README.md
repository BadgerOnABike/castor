## forestryCLUS 

### What it does

forestryCLUS is nothing more than a convenient calculator for massive calculations. 
It should be used to explore possible futures - to identify where and where not to go, explore the consequences of policy and test sensitivity. 
It was designed to provide rapid feeback - for exploring the solution space. 

### Scope


forestryCLUS simulates the forestry-caribou system where forestry policy shocks or decisions impact caribou. The figure below highlights some of the positive ('straight') and negative ('dashed') direct and indirect impacts from forestry activities
