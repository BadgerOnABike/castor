Ellen Whitman has fire severity mapped and coded since 1984. Doug Lewis a contact with this info.

Burn severity could be predicted in a multinomial model, where the response has 3 levels: low, mixed/medium, high. Then perform similar analyses to prior for logistic regression, but now trying to predict the severity of the fires we have already predicted and located on the map. I see this as a multi-level simulation, where we first predict ignition locations, then whether it escaped or not, then from here, fire size first, then which adjacent cells burn, and then what was the fire severity of that escaped fire of a given size.
