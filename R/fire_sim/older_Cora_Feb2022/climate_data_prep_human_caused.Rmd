In the first stage of the analyses, we assessed only lightning caused fires. Here, we will now create the model for the human-caused fires. Many of the same variables will be important (e.g., climate, topography, VRI vegtype, BEC Zone), but an additional variable that will be needed is road density. Currently we have a layer for 2018 that shows the roads at that time (including approved roads that may not exist). Many papers have assumed a constant road density across time into the past and into the future. We may do this, or we may attempt to use the road clus to estimate annual roads from 2002 to 2020 and get more accurate densities. We will assume road densities for future projections will remain constant for the last year we have densities for.

Bring in the fire.ignition.clipped data and inspect.

```{r}
fire.ignition.clipped<-st_read(dsn="C:\\Work\\caribou\\clus_data\\Fire\\Fire_sim_data\\fire_ignition_hist\\bc_fire_ignition_clipped.shp")

head(fire.ignition.clipped)
table(fire.ignition.clipped$fire_cause) #Majority person caused; still have both lightning and person caused fires. Good!

#Check projection
st_crs(fire.ignition.clipped)
fire.ignition.clipped<-st_transform(fire.ignition.clipped, 3005) #transform coordinate system to 3005 - that for BC, Canada


```

We also need to bring in the BEC data again and make changes.

```{r}
#Get BEC data
bec<-getSpatialQuery("SELECT objectid, feature_class_skey, zone, subzone, natural_disturbance, zone_name, wkb_geometry FROM public.bec_zone")
st_crs(bec)

bec<-st_transform(bec, 3005) #transform coordinate system to 3005, which refers to BC, Canada
# EPSG:3005 Projected coordinate system for Canada - British Columbia. This CRS name may sometimes be used as an alias for NAD83(CSRS) / BC Albers.
#plot(bec[, "zone"]) # check we got the whole province
st_crs(bec)


```

```{r}

##Can use keyring
conn <- DBI::dbConnect (dbDriver ("PostgreSQL"), 
                        host = keyring::key_get('dbhost', keyring = 'postgreSQL'), 
                        dbname = keyring::key_get('dbname', keyring = 'postgreSQL'), 
                        port = '5432',
                        user = keyring::key_get('dbuser', keyring = 'postgreSQL'),
                        password = keyring::key_get('dbpass', keyring = 'postgreSQL'))

fire_igni_bec<- st_read (dsn = conn, 
          layer = c ("public", "fire_ignit_by_bec"))
dbDisconnect (conn)

str(fire_igni_bec)
```



## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
