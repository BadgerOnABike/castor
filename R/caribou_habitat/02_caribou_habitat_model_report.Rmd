## Introduction

Rport on creation of caribou habitat model

Met with wildife bios in PG, FSJ, Smithers adn Cranborrk to get input on model


## Methods

### key poitns from workshops with reagional biologists
General:
- lienar featrues in core cariobu habtait are bad; lienar density
- Basal area is good representation of forest attributes desirable to caribou
- fire
- cutblock characteristics; slope, snow, roads
- disatcne to permamabnet human ladn use (ag)

Boreal:
- Demars RSFs for boreal?
- DU wetland data

Nrothern
- low elevation, pine-lichen stands
- high leavtion
- terretiral lichen
- sub-alpine arboreal lichen


Moutnain cariobu:
- habtait could be simpyl dfined by elevation and BEC 
  - some herds at high elevation yer round, others seasonal
- snow is imrptoant in soutehrn herds; coudl use elvation as a proxy, but PAS may also be useufl 
- BEC is a key covriate in moutnain cariobu ecoptype
  - ineractison with snow depth and seral satge likely also important
  - BEC and lichen?
- old growth forest >150 y.o. adn arboral lichen
- new colalr data form revelstoke affected by pen
- balasm leading 
- ESSF
- low elevation cedar-hemlock



### habitat covariates to include in model
elevation (m)
slope (degrees)
aspect (easting, northing, direction?)
cutblock density (1 ha) 
  <5 years old (yo)
  5-10 yo
  10-20 yo
  20-30 yo
  30-40 yo
  40-50 yo
  50-70 yo
  >70 yo
  
fire density (1 ha)
  <5 years old (yo)
  5-10 yo
  10-20 yo
  20-30 yo
  30-40 yo
  40-50 yo
  50-70 yo
  >70 yo

road length (density) (1 ha)
  paved
  loose
  ....
  
forest age (vri or cutblcok or fire)
