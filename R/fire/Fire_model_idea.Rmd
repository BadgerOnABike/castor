## Introduction

- here are some ideas and lit. review about how to go about developing a 'fire model' for caribou recovery

## Possible Approaches

### FAIB - TSA 16 Fire Modeling Methodology

They model it in STSM with a four step process. 

1.) Examine the fire regime in study area by getting spatial files of historic fire perimeters and BC wildfire Provincial Strategic Threat Analysis (PSTA) dataset which determines threat of fires to different areas. THey then calculate how much of the area was burned since fire data is available and from this determine how long it would take for an equivalent area of the forested portion of the TSA to burn (referred to as rotation period). The inverse of the rotation period (1/rotation period) is the expected annual rate of disturbance or in other words the proportion of the total forested area burned per year.

2.) Establish a theoretical simulated distribution. Using the fire perimeter data they fit a distribution to a log transformation of the data e.g. using fitdistrplus in R and test whether the determined distribution is a good fit.

3.) Parametrize the timber supply model. They parameterized the SELES model with parameters such as 20% of the burned forest being destroyed, the rest is then available for harvest for the next 5 years after which the amount of available timber is set to 0%. Where a fire initially ignites is dependent on the PSTA wildfire threat analysis layer with areas with higher hazard having a greater probability of ignition and the subsequent fire patch size is determined from the lognormal distribution. Also fire preferentially spreads to higher hazard areas.

4.) the model is then run and the distributions are reviewd. They also examine scenarios where fire frequency is increased so that it doubles over a 100 year period to examine the impacts of that.

### Marchal et. al. (2020) Turning down the heat: Vegetation feedbacks limit fire regime responses to global warming. Ecosystems 23: 204-216.

These authors simulate annual fire activity from 2011 to 2099 in hard wood, mixed wood and coniferous forests in Quebec.  They used a spatial resolution of 1ha and temporal resolution of 1 year. For the study area they classified vegetation into 5 different fuel types: Hardwoods (HW), conifers (CN), disturbed (D), open (O), and open water (WT). Areas that were less than 15 years since disturbance were classified as disturbed, areas with >50% basal area of hard wood  or conifer were classified as HW or C and everything else was labeled O.They then simulated vegetation dynamics as fuel-type trajectories and assumed that fires were stand replacing. After a fire they tested various scenarios of vegetation trajectories on future fires. The scenarios are 
1.) there is no change in category. After a fire HW areas stay HW, cN areas stay CN and open areas stay open.
2.) there is a 15 year lag. In the first 15 years after fire the area is classified as disturbed then after 15 years it goes back to what it was before the disturbance.
3.) There is a vegetation trajectory of mixedwood forests going to CN forests after 81 years. Other forest types stay as is after a disturbance.
4.) As scenario 3 except that the first 15 years after disturbance are classified as disturbed then the vegetation trajectories kick in i.e. after 81 years mixed wood forests go to coniferous.

They simulated fire by breaking down the process of burning into three processes: ignition, escape and spread which were each modelled separately as functions of fire weather and vegetation. 

They simulated spread across the landscape using the spread function in SpaDES package, which immulates bond percolation where fire spreads from a burning cell to an unburned neighbouring cell according to some probability. This probability depends on fire size distributional parameters (predicted from fuels and weather). They tested their fire spread model by simulating fire spread of known fires between the years 2000 - 2010 using known vegetation and fire weather data to parameterize the model over time and also simulated out into the future.

Ignition: they developed predictive statistical models of annual fire frequency as a function of fire weather and fuel type. Fire weather was represented as the month drought code (Van Wagner 1987).

Escape: they used logistic regression to predict sensitivity to  fire weather and vegetation conditions. They then estimated the probability that a fire would be at least 1ha in size (escape) and derived an equation for this. 

### Lakes TSA Discussion paper 2019
Seems like they did not include fire in the future forecasts. Rather they obtained layers of historical fires (fire perimeter) and burn severities (to classify injury to trees i.e. amount of timber that is still harvestable) and adjusted the available timber volumes from those. 

### Marchal J, Cumming SG, McIntire EJB (2017) Exploiting poisson additivity to predict fire frequency from maps of fire weather and land cover in boreal forests of Quebec, Canada. Ecography 40: 200-209.

Here they statistically predict the probability that a fire will start in a 10 x 10km pixel as a result of lightning or humans. The first thing they do is determine vegetation categories for each pixel and calculate the proportion of these vegetation categories in each pixel. Vegetation categories are: coniferous (<50% of basal area deciduous), hardwood (>50% of basal area is deciduous), disturbed (disturbed within past 15 years), and open or open water. 
They then obtained fire counts and determined the cause to classify then as lighting or human.
They also obtained weather data: max monthly temp, monthly precipitation, and they estimated monthly drought code (MDC) using the equation in Begeron et. al. (2010) (Will climate change drive 21st century burn rates in Canadian boreal forest outside of its natural variability: collating global climate model experiments with sedimentary charcoal data. Int J. Wildland Fire 19: 1127-1139).

Then they performed negative binomial regressions (because of overdispersion in the count data) looking at the relationship between each of the weather variables and lighting or human caused weather. They tried various combinations of weather including each month alone, and combinations of months together. Overall they found that July monthly drought code was the best predictor of fires using AICc. 

Then they examined the relationship between fire ignition and fire weather (MDC) and vegetation type/land cover by testing each term individually, and with the interaction between them. They also examined fire weather with varying slopes for vegetation, fire weather with varying slopes and intercepts, and some fancy pants models where they allowed break points i.e. changes in slope because a visual examination of fire weather and vegetation suggested there might be break points. 

Overall they found that for lighting caused fires models with varying intercepts and slopes and break points was best. Although if you examine the results the model with just varying intercepts and slopes and no breakpoints was not far behind. 

For human caused fires they also included road densities within the pixel as a model term. Here they found the best model was a model that allowed varying intercepts and slopes according to vegetation type and included the interaction between fire weather and road density. Models with breakpoints were not better in this case. Again they used AICc to determine the top candidate model. 

### Approaches

### Approach to making fire model

## 1.) Following methods outlined in Marchal et al. 2017. Ecography calculate the probability of ignition according to vegetation type and fire weather.

To do this I need to get the following layers: 
1.) history of fire ignitions in BC both lighting and human caused. I need to split these ignitions up because models for human caused versus lighting caused fires are probably a little different
2.) get a vegetation layer particularly forestry layer that has information about the kinds of trees i.e. deciduous versus coniferous. Also get disturbance information (Kyle's cutblocks layer) for the same years as we have fire ignition data.
3.) get weather data: monthly means of daily mean temp, monthly means of average daily temp, monthly means of daily max temp, monthly precipitation.
4.) estimate monthly drought code following Bergeron et al (2010) Int. J. Wildland Fire 19: 1127-1139
using the following equations. I'm a bit confused but I think they must assume that MDC is 0 in March and then calculate the April value from that. Not sure this is right but maybe its close enough?

Evapotranspiration = # days in month * (0.36 (monthly mean of daily max Temp) + day length adjustment factor)

DC_half (Drought Code for first half of month = MDC_0 (MDC value from previous month) + 0.25 Evapotranspiration

MDC for second half of month after rainfall for that month happens  is calculated as follows:

Q_mr (moisture equivalent after rain) =  [3.937*(0.83 * rainfall (in mm))]/800*     exp(- MDC_0/400)

MDC_m (Drying over second half of month) = DC_half + 0.25Evapotranspiration






## Rothermel Fire Spread Model

Vacchiano et al. (2015) An Implementation of the Rothermel Fire Spread Model in the R Programming Language. Fire Technology

This paper outlines a R package that estimates the rate of a fires spread [ros()] by implementing the Rothermel Equation. Essentially this equation is a physics based equation and calculates rate of spread as heat source divided by heat sink. It takes into account fuel characteristics such as fuel load i.e. amount of fuel per ha, surface area to volume ratio of fuel, fuel moisture contents,  how much moisture is needed in the fuel for fire extinction, how much heat different fuels give out, slope and wind characteristics. These values feed in to calculating the rate of spread.

I could use this equation with these fuel characteristics and topography and use it to give the fire a probability of spread to the next cell or to define how the fire is spreading.

##Additional thoughts and considerations added by Cora Skaien
1. Liz captures most of my initial thoughts above (lightning versus human caused fires may need to be modelled separate at least initially, projecting climate and vegetation change into the future for the models)
2. How to best combine human and lightening predicted fire data once complete? Additive effects in some areas that may have medium to high probabilities for both.
   # See STSM2020_p5_AdvancedComponents file for section 1.5 for parameter table for how to incorporate mutiple influences (0/1)
3. Do we have data on where thunderstorms are most likely to occur (e.g., specific mountain ranges and how weather patterns interact with them)? Lightning strike data --> Tyler thinks this might already be incorporated.
4. recently burned areas less like to burn again: create probability map for areas where prescribed burns occurred. Could use data where prescribed burns occurred over last 20+ years and data where natural forest fires occurred and create probability map using each pixel, considering occurrence and intensity of wildfires (if any) after prescribed burns. Compare to control pixels randomly selected but with similar environmental variables to areas that were selected for prescribed burn. Perhaps fuel reductions are already accounted for in recent aerial photos that will be used, however.
5. Current models being run assume all fires and stand replacing. Consider lower intensity fires as well for relevant BEC zones? Find any sources or data that indicate fire severity.
6. Some models in Marchal et al. 2020 are already available in SPaDES. Check these out and see if any are relevant and useful?
7. We need to determine how to best model how our forest composition changes after disturbance given different forest types compared to Quebec. Often we have deciduous pop up I believe still in the interior --> is this true for all BEC zones?
8. Is there any data on rates of conversion of wetlands to forest? Much of the open water part is exclusively open water, so maybe this is not a concern, but wetlands are likely ot burn less unless converted I assume.
9. Consider (semi-)natural fire breaks, such as roads, when considering spread. Logging roads vs paved roads as fire breaks? Look into. This will be important for the spread model.
10. Predicted climate change (monthly drought index, etc) with Web app to explore CMIP6 projections for BC if not already incorporated.
11. Can we incorporate spread from one BEC type to another?
12. Interesting ideas and resources a bit tangential maybe in this webinar, talking about forest succession after a fire, using LANDSAT to determine fire severity, and fuel breaks (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FS7yz1JKdTs)
13. Slope and Aspect likely important. Slope important for spread, and aspect important for ignition?
- "Because of the local, up-slope winds, wildfires usually burn up-slope. The steeper the slope, the more rapidly the fire will burn up-slope (and more intensely). The reason is because of both greater radiant heat and greater convective heat." "Aspect is the direction that a slope faces.  The direction a slope faces determines how much radiated heat it will receive from the sun.  Slopes facing south to southwest will receive the most solar radiation.  As a result, this slope is warmer than slopes facing a northerly direction.  The warmer slope results in lower relative humidity, higher temperatures and rapid loss of moisture.  The fuel will tend to be dryer flashy-type that ignites and burns readily.  The period that fires will ignite and burn will also be longer on south-facing slopes." http://www.auburn.edu/academic/forestry_wildlife/fire/topos_effect.htm
- "In northern aspects solar radiation was lower and fuels had less water limitation to growth which, combined with steeper slopes, produced more extreme severity. In topographic fires there was more extreme severity in northern aspects with steeper slopes and in areas with more water availability and high crown biomass" (Lecina-Diaz et al. 2014) 
14. Spread days: as outlined in Wang et al. 2017, there can be no non-spread days while a fire is active, but there can be neglible spread days. Using MODIS, is it possible to create a frequency distribution of spread rates per day per fire and correlate to climate variables that are most important in ignition, escape and spread? Check out Parks 2014 and Wang et al. 2014 for more details on RSD, PSD and using MODIS for spread days.
15. If Colin Mahony can add fire weather data to ClimateBC over the coming years, it would be so wonderful to create a new model using those data and comparing it to this model. Can take most recent year's fires as test and see which model predicts best, and assess areas of greatest difference in future predictions between the models for each 20 year period. End of Discussion in Wang et al. 2017, they do a brief comparison to a model that used monthly climate variables (Boulanger et al. 2014) to compare to their models. Doing this more explicitly with our models would be really useful!

##Notes on Pariesen et al. 2019. Applications of simulation-based burn probability modelling: a review
This paper provides a good historical overview of Burn probability Models (BP) and its uses. This paper aims to: (1) describe the inputs and outputs of BP models; (2) provide an overview of applications of these models; (3) demonstrate common applications through case studies; and (4) develop a comprehensive list of published studies using the BP method.

The paper emphasizes the need to first create baseline outputs, which are not necessarily simplistic. But this initial model offers a departure point for alternate scenarios, and can provide a reference state to assess change.

Examples of inputs: 
   - fuels (e.g., land cover, flammable biomass, unburnable areas)
   - topography
   - spatio-temporal patterns of ignition
   - fire weather
   
Suggested considerations include:
   - classifying areas into fuel types (e.g., BEC zone)
   - different causes (human vs. lightning)
   - If fires will burn for days, incorporate realistic day to day variability in weather, or drawing sequential fire-conductive conditions from historical data
   - can account for topographic relief on wind speed and wind direction (e.g., WindNinja grids)
   
This paper also discusses the importance of model calibration: generally via heuristic and iterative manner by adjusting inputs and assessing outputs through comparison of actual and simulated fires.

Four key types of outputs: (1) ignition points; (2) associated fire perimeter; (3) BP maps; (4) fire behaviour maps.

Three key purposes of BP models: (1) direct examination; (2) neighbourhood processes; (3) hazard and risk. Direct examination is often a direct comparison, with fire maps side by side for different scenarios, or a 'difference' map that represents differences between two scenarios. Neighbourhood processes tell us where fires arecoming from relaive to an area of concern, and can also assess "source-sink" ratio to describe each pixel's propensity for producing or receiving a fire -- potential applications for between regions such as BEC zones too. Fire hazard combined fire probability and a quantitative assessment of fire behaviour; wildland fire risk is a product of fire likelihood and potential impacts of wildfire (positive and negative). This can apply to estimating expected financial losses, ecological habitat change and carbon emissions. 

An element not included in any models in Canada is long distance spotting events, and they suggest that making fuel breaks partially flammable can help partially account for this short-fall.


##Summary of Considerations for modelling burn probability across landscapes with steep environmental gradients: an example from the Columbia Mountains, Canada by Parisien et al. 2012.
In this paper, the authors create a Burn Probability (BP) model for the area around Revelstoke BC, taking into account topography and windspeed. Many elements have been touched on previously, such as modeling separately by fule type (BEC zone) and by ignition type, with human and lightning caused fires modeled separately and incorporating road density into the bhuman-caused fire model. Some other key elements they performed that warrant consideration by us include:
   1.Fire duration - really important to know fire duration. Can create frequency distributions for duration for each BEC zone. Can also model spread based off of this. Really important for escape and spread.
   2. Topography - really important to include for fire behaviour (DEM). More important for spread than ignition IMO.
   3. Wind direction and speed - can be modelled with WindNinja based on DEM. Really important for escape and spread.
   4. Fire Spread Rate - used satellited-detected hot spots from 1994-2010 and fancy stats to estimate how big the fire was each day and then estimate spread rate. Could do a simpler model where take fire size and divide by number of burn days and predict a constant rate of spread. If can get daily spread, and correlate to daily fire weather, would be even better. However, future predictions will mostly be climate, so creating a distribution of spread rates from ClimateBC data and average spread rate probably sufficient.
   5. Could assess if seasonality of fires is important by BEC zone
   6. Solar radiation from aspect and slope - this can be really important to the probability of ignition
   7. The importance of non-linearity of variables and using quadratic, or other, transformations.
   8. Fragmented areas - probability of spread was lower in fragmented areas. Account for in spread.
   9. Test spread rates against historical data because often over-predicted from model and may need a correcting factor.
   10. Also discuss the need to account for fire suppression activities.
   
   
##Notes from Wang et al. 2016 "Future burn probability in south-central British Columbia"
"A spread day represents a day when a non-negligible area is burned by the fire and is usually associated with the presence of fire-conducive weather (Parisien et al. 2005; Podur and Wotton 2011; Wang et al. 2014). We determined the number of spread days in the observed period from a historical database of daily fire progressions derived from Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) fire detections from 2000 to 2009 using the method described in Parks (2014). To differentiate spread and non-spread days, we used a threshold based on a calculated rate of spread of$1m min 1 based on 4 h of burning (per day) and assuming circular growth, as described in Parisien et al. (2013). Frequency distributions of the number of spread days were produced for each fire zone; they are largely responsible for the size variation of simulated fires. As such, we made some adjustments to the spread day distributions for the simulated fire sizes to match the observed ones. The distributions were also smoothed to reduce noise."
   - maximum 7 spread days
   
##Wang, X., Parisien, M-A., Taylor, S.W., Candau, J-N., Stralberg, D., Marshall, G.A., Little, J.M., and Flannigan, M.D. 2017. Projected changes in daily fire spread across Canada over the next century. Environmental Research Letters, 12: 025005.
Highlights that by estimating by monthly, annual or decadal climate patterns, we miss out on the relevant day-to-day fire spread. These authors used CMIP5, MODIS, historical weather observations and national fire database of Canada to estimate the potential changes in the number of active burning days of wildfire and relating spread days to daily fire-conducive weather. Their results suggest that the number of fire spread days could increase 2-3 times in Eastern Canada and a 50% increase in Western Canada.

Some variables they suggest to be important: the number of fire-conducive weather days per month, number of rain-free days. Differentiate between potential spread days (when fire weather is conducive to spread) and realized spread days (when fire actually spreading). They also highlight that there can be no days when a fire is not spreading, as it would be extinguished, but that there are negligible spread days that are characterized by surface fire type behaviour with head fire rates typically <0.3 km/hr.They outline required conditions really in introduction and highlight that extreme fire weather might not result in realized spread days due to (a) lack of flammable biomass, (b) geographic impediment to spread, (c) successful fire suppression, (d) or lack of ignitions. Therefore, realized spread days (RSD) < potential spread days (PSD). This paper actually estimated the number of potential spread days (PSD) and realized spread days (RSD) using a correction factor: they highlight their 8-step process for calculating baseline and future PSD and RSD.

Used Parks (2014) methodology using MODIS. Used Wang et al. (2014) to determine spread vs. non-spread days. They emphasize the importance of a good link function between PSD and RSD to get the correct correction factors.

When comparing their results to one that used monthly climate variables (Boulanger et al. 2014), Wang et al. found that patterns of annual area burned were almost the inverse between the 2 studies!  Differences may be a result of temporal data resolution, or may be differences in GCMS (Global Climate Models) used and other variables.

Authors emphasize the confounding effects of fire suppression efforts both before and during fires, and that we must assumethese efforts remain constant moving into the future, but this may not be the case.

Cora's thoughts: If we were to get estimates of PSD from future ClimateBC info, we would potentially need to alter results by some scaling factor to account for if too high (some other papers did this scaling using Climate data).


##Wang, X., Parisien, M-A., Flannigan, M D., Parks, S.A., Anderson, K.R., Little, J.M., and Taylor, S.W. 2014. The potential and realized spread of wildifes across Canada. Global Change Biology, 20: 2518-2530.
Fires can burn for weeks or months, but not all of the burn days are 'spread' days. Most sread occurs on a small proportion of actual burn days (e.g., 1-15) and may not necessarily be consecutive days during the active burn period. In this paper, they outline how to determine potential spread days (PSD) and realized spread days (RSD). They found substantial variability between PSD and RSD. PSD and RSD greater in Western than Eastern Canada. PSd has a decreasing pattern from South to North, but no such pattern with RSD. RSD:PSD ratio considering higher in Northern Canada, and they attribute this to (1) more coniferous veg (more flammable), (2) lesser human impacts (less fragmentation), (3) sufficient fire ignitions and (4) intense droughts (also (5) longer daylight hours during fire season). Here, the authors create simple linear relationships between PSD and RSD for each fire zone that create a simple correction factor. These data can be used to estimate RSD from weather-based data in regions where fire databases are poor.

In temperate and boreal forests, large fires (1-10000 km square) are infrequent but account for most of the area burned. They may burn for weeks to months and rain-free periods largely dictate how long they can burn, but also contingent on number of fire conducive days for spread. Conducive spread days = hot, dry and windy. 

Data: Assign fire zones across Canada by 'homogenous' fire zones created by Boulanger et al. 2012. Used weather stations across Canada to calculate Fire Weather Index (FWI): temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and 24 hour precipitation to calculate three fuel moisture codes and three fire-weather indices. PSD defined as when FWI > 19 (although Wang et al. 2017 used 20). Defined rain free period by Duff Moisture Code (DMC), wherein the DMC was used when FWI > 20. DMC good predictor of fire spread potential in boreal forests and provides a numerical rating of moisture content of organic layer 1-6 cm in forest floor. Table 1 has variables used: Mean T, mean ppt, seasonal severity rating (derived from weather stations), ratio of conifer:other tree spp., percent non-fuel (e.g., rock, urban, irrigated agriculture, open water), mean human footprint index, Mean annual area burned. Used MODIS to estimate spread following Parks 2014, and MODIS fire detection dayswere interpolated using the 'weighted by mean and distance' (WMD) method. Uses 30 m x 30 m resolution and equation presented in paper. Using 5 closest MODIS detection points was found to be more accurate than using other methods, such as nearest neighbour. MODIS has 2 types of fire detections:(1) actively burning fire front and (2) smoldering combustion after flaming front passed through. They limited their analysis to fires > 200 ha. Numerous equations presented toi compare and transform the frequency distributions, and then use these in a linear regression model.

Spread days are defined as days when fire spread exceed 240 m (rate of at least 1 m/minute assuming 4 hour burn period each day and circular growth). They indicate this should not be indicative of actual fire progression, but instead just to simply estimate spread and non-spread days.

Also assessed the association between RSD/PSD with each of the environmental variables in Table 1 to get an idea of correlates and contributors. Remember: PSD = Number of days where FWI >20, and RSD: actual value from MODIS hot spot analysis. Main correlates to PSD are seasonal severity rating (r=0.60) and surface-area ratio (r=0.61), a measure of topographic roughness. Realized spread correlates strongest were: mean total precip (r = -0.70) and mean annual area burned (r = 0.72). RSD:PSD strongest: mean temp (r = -0.75), mean human footprint index (r =-0.75) (but these 2 co-vary).  Degree to which potential fire spread is realized is correlated with: proportion of coniferous cover (r = 0.60).

Discrepancy between PSD and RSD seem to be due to bottom-up (nonclimatic; vegetation and topography) variables as opposed to top-down (climate).

Smoke and cloud cover can obscure MODIS images and can be lost data. Previous studies have demonstrated that longer droughts (potential burn periods) during fire season are likely to produce larger and more severe fires.

key: need daily fire weather metrics, but then can estimate potential spread days from that and scale to an estimate for realized spread days. Potential useful for future applications of Colin Mahony gets fire weather variables into ClimateBC/ClimateWNA.

##Parks. S.A. 2014. Mapping day-of-burning with coarse-resolution satellite fire-detection data. International Journal of Wildfire, 23: 215-223.
MODIS data is at 1 km-square resolution, so data needs to be downscaled if want an area that is less. This paper presents a method for doing exactly this. The methods in this paper will be particularly important for future models if daily fire weather variables are available.

This paper presents multiple ways (Day 2) to estimate Day of Burning (DOB) for fires of a certains size threshold. MODIS has a 1 km resolution, so some of our 1 ha fires may or may not show up here and this may limit our spread day estimates? DOB was estimated for each pixel within each fire perimeter using several interpolation techniques (Table 2), with code from Parks available with no restrictions. Three step process: (1) All MODIS fire detection data overlapping and within 1 km of final fire perimeter were selected for use in interpolation, and they removed fires <100 ha; (2) estimate DOB for each pixel within each fure perimeter using all 10 interpolation methods in Table 2; (3) reassigned all spatially contiguous interpolated DOB regions that were <=25 ha to DOB values of the nearest regions larger than 25 ha. Parks was able to make a pixel at resolution of 30 m x 30 m, so hopefully it is easy to make interpolation to 100 m x 100 m.

If a fire detection was noted before 12 noon, it was assigned the day before for start date. Of the 10 methods, similar but subtley different results were created. When compared to known data, the weighted by meand and distance (WMD) did best. However, the 6 top performing methods were all similar (IDW, IDW.sq, IDW.half, WMD.sq and AD with WMD).

These methods increase accuracy compared to using sigmoidal growth function as a function of fire duration and final size (which is our other option). Some limitations: ground proofing data hard to come by; smoke, canopy cover and clouds can obscure detections; individual pixels in fast moving or low intensity fires may go undetected. 

The authors suggest that these methods may be inappropriate for small fires <500 ha in size. The average size for our lightning caused fires is 262 ha and for person caused fires is 26 ha... so we may encounter some problems!

Looking at maps (Figure 4), we can see where fires started and ended, which can give us guidance to direction fires travelled. Could we make a raster with this information? It would be very coarse, but hopefully we could correlate it to topography?

##Flannigan, M.D., Logan, K.A., Amiro, B.D., Skinner, W.R., and Stocks, B.J. 2005. Future area burned in Canada. Climate Change 71:1-16.
Authors here investigated how weather, fire weather index and area burned relate to each other. They found that temperature and fuel moisture were the best variables to relate to historical monthly area burned with 36-64% of variance explained depending on ecozone. Their results predict significant increases in burned area by end of century by 74-118%, but they do not account for changes in vegetation, ignitions, fire season length and human activity.

They highlight four factors that influence fire activity: weather/climate, fuels, ignition agents and humans. They suggest that in Canada, climate/weather is the most significant factor influencing fires. It determined fuel moisture, influences lightning ignitions and contributes to fire growth through wind action. Many factors influence in addition though, including but not limited to: extent of forest, topography, habitat fragmentation, fuel characteristics, season, latitude, fire suppression policies, fire site accessibility, etc.

The data used included start date, location, cause and final size of fire. Log-transformed are burned (size) data. Use weather stations and Environment Canada to get temperature, RH, wind speed and 24-hour precipitation at noon to calculate the Fire Weather Index (FWI). They used a thin-plate cubic-spline technique (Falnnigan and Wooton 1989) between weather stations to interpolate. There was a discrepency between reported precipitation and actual measured precip, so they used a correction factor.

GCMs can come as monthly anomaly data (in which if the value is 5 degrees, then you add 5 degrees to the baseline value), or you can use daily data directly. The daily approach allows daily precip to change, whereas the monthly approach constrains you to historical data, and daily precip is very important for fire behaviour. Most fire spread occurs during a few days that coincide with severe fire weather. They found that larger spatial units (ecozones) had better results than finer spatial units (ecogroups). Authors emphasize the need to include changing fuel type in future studies. They found that the length of the fire season was predicted to increase by 20% or 30 days by the end of the century. But they indicate also that they did not account for habitat fragmentation from agriculture, urban development and trasnporation corridors which should decrease the extent burned. 

Authors emphasize tyhat using daily weather was more accurate than monthly climate averages.

##Beverly, J.L., and McLoughlin, N. 2019. Burn probability simulation and subsequent wildland fire activity in Alberta, Canada - Implications for risk assessment and strategic planning. Forest Ecology and Management 451: 117490.
Burn probability maps use Monte Carlo methods to create repeated simulations of fire ignition and spread across a study area landscape to identify locations that burn more frequently than others. These authors compared burn probability maps to actual burned area 5 years after creation. Depending on burn probability maps, results were variable from fires occurring where models least predicted them, to reasonable accuracy. Quantile classification was better at predicting actual burned area than Jenks natural breaks, equal interval and defined interval.

Burn probability (BP): assessed as the number of times a location burned in relation to the number of independent trials or model iterations. Displayed as a heat map. Monte Carlo simulations creating these heat maps have been used to generate 'hot spots' and 'cold spots' in Spain, Korea, US, Canada and Greece. Authors emphasize that model results are dependent on the historical time period and choice of study area, and how ignitions, spread and fire size are modelled.

Often burn probability maps are created to compare against mitigation alternatives and different climate scenarios. I would REALLY like to include fire mitigation into the probability for each (ignition, escape and spread) down the road and see if there is any difference. 

In the second last paragraph of introductions, the authors address the importance of map classification methods, number of bins (classes), and colour selection in map interpretation and designation of 'hot spots'. Natural breaks (Jenks) vs other breaks, few vs many bins/classes. Within their study regions, they account for both total area and total burnable area(total area minus water and non-fuel land cover types). Burn probability mapping is typically displayed with classes as opposed to stretched continuous display: easier for land managers to interpret. A very large number of bins approximate a continuous map.

Here, they used Burn-P3 with Prometheus, which utilizes DEM, landcover type,and and fire weather. Number and sizes simulated are constrained by user-defined fire regime and fire environment attributes input into the model. Program is calibrated with real data. They used 28-54 years of fire data for calibration. Defined scaped fires as > 4 ha for most regions, except one region where it was defined as >10 ha. They calculate the proportion of fires > 4 and 10 ha respectively. This may be useful for us to do too.

Proportions of burn probability values within burned areas were compared with null model proportions with chi square tests. Distributions of burn probability values in burned and unburned areas compared with Wilcoxin rank sum test. They found often that areas that burned subsequently were in areas that had a low probability of burning in the models, and that burn probabilities mapped with high spatial precision performed poorly. 

Threshold choice also important. Some use 50th percentile threshold, others higher value. Here, using the 50th percentile, resulting in half the study area being predicted to occur in a high probability of being burned zone. Here, quantile classification performed best, with 3 breaks. These authors caution using Burn-P3 results in fire management decisions.

Goal of paper: (1) assess fire ignition occurrence in terms of probability and frequency; (2) compare main drivers affecting fire occurrence; (3) produce fire probability and frequency maps for each region (Spain and Italy). Used Negative Binomial Hurdle Models. Results: inverse correlation between fire and distance to infrastructure. Land cover type also important, with forest, agriculture and grassland most affected by fires.Although climate, topography and landscape important, anthropogenic factors were more important in these regions. 

This paper cites many papers that have previously used logistic regression, geographically weighted logistic regression, and machine learning techniques, with counts of fires also using Poisson and negative binomial regression (paragraph 2 of introduction). Here, they use hurdle models which work better with non-normal distributions (e.g., many 0s for no ignition, and relatively only a few 1s for where ignitions occur). Poisson Hurdle models can be used for fire size.

Variables investigated: Temp (mean, max), dry days, elevation, slope, population density, distances to roads, urban area distance, land cover (%, 8 classes). Data was assessed via P/A fire and the number of ignitions per cell (1 km square grid).

Hurdle models shape count data with a preponderance of 0s. In the hurdle part, logistic regression is used for P/A (1/0) of fires, then the negative binomial regression is a function of probability for the count part of the data. Negative Binomial Hurdle is recommended when the observed outcome has an average lower than the variance. Here, they used the hurdle() function from the R 'pscl' package. Requires have fire ignition point frequency by cell. Data was split into training (70%) and validation data, using AUC for logistic regression and Pearson correlation coefficient and root mean square error (RMSE) for the count part.

Elevation was negatively correlated with fire ignitions in 2/3 regions, but positive in the third. Most other studies have found a negative coreelation, but what fuel is at higher elevations in different regions may reverse the relationship. Negative relationship found with distance to roads and to infrastructur - this was due to arson and negligence. Population density had limited predictive power.  

Thought to ponder: take number of fires per month from 2002-2020 and correlate with variables to get predictions for number of fires by climate, etc? If need to bound how many fires may occur. May wish to use Hurdle Models for the ignition portion of the models! Then add escape, size and spread to the next steps subsequent to this. HOWEVER: Because we are not taking EVERY cell and assessing fire or not, we may be under-representing zeros, and Hurdle Models may not be the best solution... ponder...

The authors of this paper review the current understanding of wildfire predictions for the future. They indicate that "To date, research suggests a general increase in area burned and fire occurrence but there is a lot of spatial variability, with some areas of no change or even decreases in area burned and occurrence." Fire season length is increasing in temperate and boreal forests and predicted to continue this trend. They suggest that models need to all account for weather/climate, vegetation, people and other disturbances.

The first paragraph of this paper offers a great historical persepctive: fire size 1960-2000 ranged from 273 to 567 Mha (average: 383 Mha), with estimates 2000-2005 closer to 608 Mha/year, predominately in grasslands and Savannahs of Africa and Australia (but also South Asia and South America), and then forested regions. These authors suggest that long-term fire data show a gradual global monotonic increase in wildfire since the last glacial maximum 21,000 years ago (although I have heard contrary insights from fire experts, or they may have been talking more on the scale of 100,000s of years). There is greater percent area burned in the southern hemisphere compared to the northern hemisphere.

Forest fires contribute to carbon balance through immediate release of CO2, CH4 and CO, and slow release afterwards as decay releases more CO2 into the atmosphere. The impact varies among biomes, however. Primary driver for carbon balance in boreal forest. "For fires to spread, there needs to be fuel continuity; some suggest that at least 30% of the landscape needs to have fuel for a fire to spread (Hargrove et al. 2000)." "...understorey shrubs in a forest can act as ladder fuels that carry a surface fire up into tree crowns and generate a much more intense fire." "Cary et al. (2006) found that weather and climate best explained model area burned estimated from landscape fire models compared with variation in terrain and fuel pattern. Carcaillet et al. (2001) found that climate was the key process triggering fire over the eastern boreal forest during the Holocene. Prasad et al. (2008) found that mean annual temperature and average precipitation of the warmest quarter of the year were among the variables that best explained fire occurrence in southern India." Lots of good additional sources and comments on influence of climate on probability of fire.

In regards to future fires, they highlight the importance of weather (climate and wind), fuels and changing vegetation. Humans are the unknown factor. "The FWI (Fire Weather Index) in Canada is expected to increase, but with significant regional variation (Bergeron and Flannigan 1995; Amiro et al. 2001)." 

Area burned (spread) influenced by: size sample area, time, topography, habitat fragmentation, fuel characteristics, season, latitude, fire suppression, fire site accessibility, ignitions, climate-weather and simultaneous fires.

In Canada: "Area burned was projected to increase by as much as 5.7 times the present values, but for many sites, the historical area burned (1600s to near present) was higher than estimated future fire activity."

Ignitions: "The direct effect of climate change on fire occurrence will be through fire weather, as it affects the moisture content and sustained ignition of fuel." "In a study of wildfire in the western USA, Westerling et al. (2006) found that fire season length had increased by over 2 months over the 1980s, using data from 1970 to 2003, and attribute the earlier start of the fire season to earlier snowmelt from higher spring and summer temperatures. In a case study in the province of Ontario, Canada, analysis of the date of initial fire activity showed progressively earlier starts to the fire season over the last two decades (R. McAlpine, pers. comm.)."

Authors also address fire intensity and severity. "It was suggested by Stocks (1993) that under climate change, a disproportionate number of fires may escape initial attack, resulting in very significant increases in area burned. The reasoning behind this hypothesis was that there tends to be a very narrow range in the transition between the overall suppression
system’s success or failure."

Not directly applicable to models, but applicable to greater rationale for models (not that any new rationale is needed). Abstract (terms were new to me, so summarizing accuratelt was difficult): "Persistent episodes of extreme weather in the Northern Hemisphere summer have been shown to be associated with the presence of high-amplitude quasi-stationary atmospheric Rossby waves within a particular wavelength range (zonal wavenumber 6–8). The underlying mechanistic relationship involves the phenomenon of quasi-resonant amplification (QRA) of synoptic-scale waves with that wavenumber range becoming trapped within an effective mid-latitude atmospheric waveguide. Recent work suggests an increase in recent decades in the occurrence of QRA-favorable conditions and associated extreme weather, possibly linked to amplified Arctic warming and thus a climate change influence. Here, we isolate a specific fingerprint in the zonal mean surface temperature profile that is associated with QRA-favorable conditions. State-of-the-art (“CMIP5”) historical climate model simulations subject to anthropogenic forcing display an increase in the projection of this fingerprint that is mirrored in multiple observational surface temperature datasets. Both the models and observations suggest this signal has only recently emerged from the background noise of natural variability."
