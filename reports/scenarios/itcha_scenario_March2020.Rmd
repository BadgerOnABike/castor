## Executive Summary
Here we report on the results of simulations of caribou critical habitat management scenarios developed for the Itcha-Ilgachuz caribou herd recovery plan. We took habitat management scenarios developed by Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) and British Columbia (BC) and compared them to a 'business-as-usual' (BAU) scenario in a caribou and land use simulator (CLUS). Scenarios were implemented in the CLUS as additional constraints on forestry developement within caribou critical habitat areas.

We used the CLUS model to simulate forest harvest and stand regeneration on a landscape 100 years into the future. From the model, we estimated future timber harvest, i.e., annual cut, and caribou habitat quality indicators related to forest stand age. We simulated forestry in the Quesnel and Williams Lake TSA's because they overlapped with the majority of the Itcha-Ilgachuz caribou herd. 

The ECCC and BC scenarios both used the spatial caribou critical habitat data developed by the BC government to apply new constraints in each scenario. Critical habitat was divided into several types, including high elevation winter and summer range, low elevation winter range, low elevation summer range and Matrix. Each scenario had specific limits on 'disturbance' (in this case, cutblocks and roads) applied to each habitat type.

In the modelled scenarios we considered two definitions of habitat recovery (i.e. no longer disturbed), based on age of the habitat disturbance. We considered either >40 or >30 year old cutblocks and roads as 'undisturbed' (i.e., recovered caribou habitat). In all scenarios, the CLUS model did not recover existing roads, but recovered roads simulated by CLUS. Foresty was simulated with different adjacency constraints, i.e., a forest stand could only be cut adjacent to a forest stand that had acheieved a specific height. We simulated scenarios with 3 m and a 1.5 m adjacency contraints.

The BAU scenario had the highest annual timber harvest, but lowest indicators of caribou habitat and survival. The ECCC recovery strategy and BC herd plan scenarios both reduced timber harvest and positively influenced caribou indicators. These two scenarios had similar results and resulted in an ~350,000m^3^ (15%) redcution in average annual harvested volume when the adjacency constraint was 3 m and disturbance recovery period was 40 years. However, adjacency had the largest impact on the CLUS models ability to achieve the live volume legal AAC of 2,750,000m^3^. The impact of the BC and ECCC scenarios diverged when the adjacency constraint was relaxed to 1.5 m, i.e., the BC herd plan reduced the annual harvest by 79,482^3^ (3%) and the ECCC recovery strategy reduced the annual harvest by 158,739m^3^ (6%). When adjacency was relaxed and recovery time was shortened to 30 years, the difference between the BC and ECCC scenarios was null, and the impact on annual harvest was relatively small, i.e., 39,730m^3^ (1%). However, as adjacency was relaxed, the model allowed for more early seral forest in caribou critical habitat.  

The effects of the model scenarios, on timber harvest in TSAs, and early seral forest in caribou critical habtiat types, varied substantially depending on the adjacency constraint and habitat recovery time period implemented in the model. Thus, our results suggest that the specifics of how we manage forest harvest within and outside of caribou critical habitat (i.e., beyond matrix habitat), such as adjacency requirements, can have significant implications for timber harvest and caribou habitat. They also show that there is value in investing in rapid, large-scale habitat recovery. Using the CLUS tool to support a caribou habitat recovery plan is recommended. 

## Introduction
Here we report on the results of simulations of caribou critical habitat management scenarios developed for the Itcha-Ilgachuz caribou herd recovery plan. We took habitat management scenarios developed by Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) and British Columbia (BC) and compared them to a 'business-as-usual' (BAU) scenario in a caribou and land use simulator (CLUS). Scenarios were implemented in the CLUS as additional constraints on forestry developement within caribou critical habitat areas. Below, we decribe the general methods and key parameters implemented in the CLUS model, results of model outputs and conclusions on the implications of model outputs. 

## Methods
We used the [CLUS model](https://github.com/bcgov/clus) to simulate forest harvest and regeneration on a landscape 100 years into the future. From the model, we estimated future timber harvest, i.e., annual cut, and caribou habitat quality indicators. The CLUS model mirrors models developed for timber supply reviews (TSRs), but integrates them with caribou habitat models and indicators. It uses the [provincial forest inventory](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/vri-2019-forest-vegetation-composite-layer-1-l1-) and road data developed for the provincial cumulative effects program combined with [forest tenure roads](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/forest-tenure-road-segment-lines) as key inputs on the current state of the landscape. In addition, it implements existing spatial and legal constraints on forest harvest, i.e., the timber harvest land base (THLB), [government actions regulation (GAR) orders](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/natural-resource-stewardship/laws-policies-standards-guidance/legislation-regulation/forest-range-practices-act/government-actions-regulation), [visual quality objectives](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/forestry/managing-our-forest-resources/visual-resource-management), [old growth management areas (OGMAs)](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/old-growth-management-areas-legal-current) and [biodiversity emphasis options (BEOs)](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/landscape-units-of-british-columbia-all).  

CLUS is flexible in its scale. At a minimum it simulates forestry within a single timber supply area (TSA), and where possible a supply block within a TSA. However, it can simulate all TSAs that overlap a caribou herd, because it applies common data and assumptions across TSAs. It is important to note that the CLUS model is not a copy of TSR models used to establish allowable annual cut (AAC). TSR models were designed to be specific for a particular AAC determination, whereas CLUS was designed to be general and flexible across TSAs. Although, these models all apply similar data, logic and assumptions, the CLUS model will differ from TSR models in some specific cases. Thus, CLUS model scenario outputs need to be assessed in the context of outputs from a CLUS BAU scenario, and not against a legislated AAC or other timber supply model. 

For each TSA, the CLUS model harvests timber annually with the objective of achieving the current [legislated AAC](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/forestry/managing-our-forest-resources/timber-supply-review-and-allowable-annual-cut) of live volume of timber. Thus, the CLUS model simulates the harvest of live trees only, and it may underestimate the impact of forestry on caribou where there is significant harvest of dead volume. However, the AAC uplift to harvest dead mountain pine beetle stands is reaching an end (e.g., see the current [Quesnel TSA 2017 rationale](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/farming-natural-resources-and-industry/forestry/stewardship/forest-analysis-inventory/tsr-annual-allowable-cut/quesnel_newsrelease_122-001246.pdf)), and thus the potential underestimate of future salvage harvest was expected to be minimal.

The CLUS model was implemented using the [R programming language](https://www.R-project.org/) and the [SpaDES](https://spades.predictiveecology.org/) R package. All code to run the model was posted to the BC government [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bcgov/clus), following all requirements and guidelines establshed by the BC government. 

Here we simulated forestry in the Quesnel and Williams Lake TSA's because they overlapped with the majority of the Itcha-Ilgachuz caribou herd. A portion of the herd occurred in the Prince George TSA (<1%), but that was not included in the analysis because of its small overlap.  The AAC of live volume in the [Quesnel TSA was set at 1,250,000m^3^ in 2017](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/forestry/managing-our-forest-resources/timber-supply-review-and-allowable-annual-cut/allowable-annual-cut-timber-supply-areas/quesnel-tsa) and in the [Williams Lake TSA was set at 1,500,000m^3^ in 2015](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/forestry/managing-our-forest-resources/timber-supply-review-and-allowable-annual-cut/allowable-annual-cut-timber-supply-areas/williams-lake-tsa). These annual cut targets were implemented as parameters in the CLUS model.

### Scenarios
We implemented three scenarios in CLUS:
1. Business as Usual
2. ECCC Recovery Strategy
3. BC Itcha-Ilgachuz Herd Plan 

The BAU scenario implemented the model with current, existing legal constraints (see above). The ECCC and BC scenarios implemented additional constraints on caribou critical habitat types (Table 1). Critical habitat areas were spatially defined by BC government caribou biologists with expertise working in the Itcha-Ilgachuz caribou herd range. Details on these constraints are described in the *Key Model Parameters*, below. 

```{r, table 1, scenarios, echo = F, error = F, eval = T, include = T, message = F}

            fixed_small_size = T)

```

### Key Model Parameters
Below we highlight some of the key parameters used in the CLUS model, as they have important implications for CLUS model outputs. Model results must be interpreted within the context of these parameters. 

#### Critical Habitat Constraint Types
The ECCC and BC scenarios both use the spatial caribou critical habitat data developed by the BC government. Critical habitat is divided into several types, including high elevation winter range (HEWR), high elevation summer range (HESR), which are grouped together in the Itcha-Ilgachuz herd range as high elevation winter and summer range (HEWSR), low elevation winter range (LEWR), low elevation summer range (LESR) and Matrix. Within each of those types a constraint on 'disturbance' is applied, and there are two types of constraint thresholds: 'no disturbance' and '35% disturbance'. No disturbance areas restrict any forestry or other types of development. The 35% disturbance threshold restricts development to 35% of the area of the critical habitat type. This threshold was selected based on a model developed by [ECCC for boreal caribou](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/species-risk-public-registry/related-information/boreal-caribou-science-summary.html). The model related disturbance, estimated as the area of non-overlapping fire and anthropogenic disturbance (e.g., cutblocks, roads, seismic lines, etc., mapped using sateliite imagery) buffered by 500m, to boreal caribou calf recruitment rate, and then this model was used to estimate the probability that a boreal caribou population trend (\( \lambda \)) is greater or equal to one as the area of disturbance changes (Fig. 1).

```{r FIG 1 lambda - disturb, echo = F, message = F, eval = T, fig.cap = "Figure 1. Modelled relationship between boreal caribou population trend and habitat disturbance. Source: https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/species-risk-public-registry/related-information/boreal-caribou-science-summary.html", fig.width = 1, fig.height = 3}
knitr::include_graphics( here ("reports/scenarios/images", "eccc_lambda_disturb_fig.jpg"))
```

The [ECCC recovery strategy for southern mountain caribou](https://www.registrelep-sararegistry.gc.ca/virtual_sara/files/plans/rs_woodland_caribou_bois_s_mtn_pop_0114_e.pdf) adopted the boreal disturbance model for establishing limits to disturbance in some southern mountain caribou critical habitat types (Table 1). While this model is useful because it establishes a linkage between habitat and caribou populations, there are important things to consider when using it as a threshold for managing forestry activity. First, managing disturbance as a strategy to manage forestry activity in caribou habitat is a 'blunt instrument'. It limits our ability to model more direct and specific forest management actions that may benefit caribou, including, for example, different silvicultural practices that may limit shrub production in cutblocks. Second, because it lumps all disturbance types (e.g., cutblocks, roads, fire) together, it limits our ability to account for these indpendently in the model. This is important, because cutblocks and roads influence mountain caribou differently (e.g., [DeCesare et al. 2010](https://scholarworks.umt.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1016&context=wildbio_pubs)). Third, the model was developed for boreal caribou, which live in very different habitat and have very different behaviours than mountain caribou. The model has not been tested to determine whether it is applicable to southern mountain caribou populations.  
#### Road and Cutblock Disturbance and Recovery
The CLUS model simulates forestry cutblocks and roads, both of which are considered 'disturbances'. Other disturbance features (e.g., highways, mines, agriculture) were not simulated and thus held constant in the model (e.g., no new mines were built and no mines were recovered in the model). In the modelled scenarios we considered two definitions of cutblock and road recovery, based on age of these disturbances, to assess the influence of their recovery time on timber harvest. In some scenarios we considered less than 40 year old cutblocks and roads as 'disturbed', and anything older as 'undisturbed' (i.e., recovered caribou habitat). In other scenarios we considered less than  30 year old cutblocks and roads as disturbed.

Cutblocks were considered undisturbed at 30 and 40 years old because it is a general 'rule-of-thumb' used to define a change from early to mid seral forest and lower to higher quality caribou habitat. Early seral forest stands are considered poor quality caribou habitat because they provide more forage for moose (i.e., shrubs), which can potentially increase moose and wolf density in caribou ranges, and ultimately predation on caribou ( [DeCesare et al. 2010](https://zslpublications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1469-1795.2009.00328.x); [McLellan et al. 2010](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/09-0286.1)). There is some evidence that moose prefer 10 to 30 year old stands in some parts of BC ( [Poole and Stuart-Smith 2004](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kim_Poole/publication/228974009_Winter_habitat_selection_by_moose_in_the_East_Kootenay_British_Columbia_final_report/links/55bbdc0708ae092e9660b312.pdf), [Schneideman 2018](http://web.unbc.ca/~michael/Pubs/Matt%20Scheideman%20Thesis%20Final%20for%20distribution.pdf)). In addition, a landscape model of the relationship between boreal caribou \( \lambda \) and disturbance developed in Alberta used a 30 year cutblock and fire age as a threshold to define poor caribou habtiat ( see [Appendix 2](http://www.albertacariboucommittee.ca/PDF/Athabasca-Caribou.pdf)). However, the ECCC disturbance model did not assess forest stand age and caribou habitat recovery. Disturbances, including cutblocks, were defined based on visual interpretation of satellite imagery. Thus, it is unknown whether a 30 or 40 year forest age threshold is appropriate for defining low vs. high quality caribou habitat. 

In these scenarios, the CLUS model did not recover existing roads, rather, existing roads were treated as permanent disturbances. We were unable to recover existing roads because there are no provincial-scale data on roads that includes their age or status. However, because we could track the age of newly built roads in CLUS, we were able to recover those features. We applied the same recovery parameters to new CLUS roads as we did to cutblocks. While there is research indicating that roads are poor habitat for caribou (e.g., [Dyer et al. 2002](https://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/z02-060#.XnuL1ohKiUk); [Whittington et al. 2011](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.02043.x); [Dussault et al. 2012](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rspb.2012.1700)), there appears to be limited research on how road recovery might influence caribou. Much of the research on linear feature recovery has focussed on seismic lines in the boreal forest (e.g., [Dickie et al. 2016](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2664.12732); [Finnegan et al. 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112717318078); [Tattersall et al. 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320719307013)). 

We tested the effect of varying the recovery age of cutblocks and roads from 30 to 40 years on model outputs. The recovery parameter may be highly influential on the model and thus requires careful consideration based on knowledge of caribou ecology, forest stand characteristics and road reocvery as they relate to moose forage and wolf movement in the area being modelled. For example, it is important to consider the relationship between forest age and shrub cover across a diversity of forest stand types in the area of interest. Some stands will mature faster or slower than 30 or 40 years, depending on factors such as tree species and site productivity. 

#### Fire
The CLUS model did not simulate fire. Thus, we estimated potential fire disturbance in Itcha-Ilgachuz critical habitat with a *post-hoc* analysis. We calculated the amount of area of less than 40 year old burns in each critical habitat type over the last 40 years. We then calculated the median, minimum and maximum of those values, and used this data to estimate how much disturbance could occur from fire, in addition to forestry.  

#### Cutblock Adjacency
Foresty was simulated with adjacency constraints, i.e., a forest stand could only be cut adjacent to a forest stand that had acheieved a specific height. We simulated scenarios with a 3 m and a 1.5 m adjacency contraint. This adjacency constraint can be decreased or increased to allow more flexibility in where the model can harvest. 

## Results
The BAU scenario had the highest annual timber harvest, but lowest indicators of caribou habitat and survival. The ECCC recovery strategy and BC herd plan scenarios both reduced timber harvest and positively influenced caribou indicators. These two scenarios generally had similar results relative to the BAU. There were differences between the BAU scenarios with different ajacency requirements. Detailed results on each indicator for each scenario are provided below.

### Modeled Annual Harvested Volume
Adjacency and habitat recovery time had a large impact on the CLUS models ability to achieve the live volume legal AAC of 2,750,000m^3^ (Table 2). The CLUS model harvested 2,789,446m^3^ (annual average over the 100 year simulation period) in the BAU scenario with a 1.5 m adjacency constraint, but only 2,419,556^3^ when the adjacency constraint was 3 m, a 330,444 m^3^ (12%) reduction. Implementing the ECCC recovery strategy and BC herd plan scenarios in CLUS reduced the amount harvested, but the effect varied signficantly depending on the adjacency and habitat recovery parameters that were applied in the model. With a more restrictive adjacency constraint (3 m) and conservative disturbance recovery period (40 years) the BC herd plan scenario reduced the annual harvest by 343,605m^3^ (14%) and the ECCC recovery strategy reduced the annual harvest by 361,618m^3^ (15%). When the adjacency constraint was relaxed to 1.5 m, the impact of these two scenarios diverged a bit more. Specifically, the BC herd plan reduced the annual harvest by 79,482^3^ (3%) and the ECCC recovery strategy reduced the annual harvest by 158,739m^3^ (6%). When the adjacency constraint was relaxed and recovery time was shortened to 30 years, the difference between the BC and ECCC scenarios was null, and the impact on annual harvest was relatively small, i.e., 39,730m^3^ (1%). When the recovery time was shortened to 30 years but the adjacency constraint was kept at 3 m, the model harvested close to the BAU scenario, i.e., a different of less than 4,000m^3^ (<1%).

### Actual Annual Harvested Volume
Recent billed harvest in the Quesnel and Williams Lake TSA's has been below the current live and dead stand AAC in those units (Fig. 2). Annual harvest in 2019 was at approximately 58% and 54% of the AAC in the William's Lake and Quesnel TSA's, respectively. Much of this decline may be due to a reduction in harvest of dead stands, as the majority of mountain pine beetle killed stands may have already been harvested. However, it is worth noting that recently the AAC was not being achieved in these TSAs.

### Early Seral Forest Indicator
#### Adjacency = 3 m and Recovery = 40 Years
In the scenarios with a 3 m adjacency constraint and 40 year recovery period, the amount of early seral forest (i.e., forest stands less than 40 years old) did not change in the HEWSR in the Quesnel TSA  (Fig. 3). However, under the BAU scenario, the amount of early seral forest increased up to approximately 10% of area in the LESR and up to 25% of area in the LEWR at approximately 40 years into the future. In all scenarios, the proportion of early seral forest decreased in Matrix habitat, however, it declined to less than 5% in approximately 35 years in the BC and ECCC scenarios, and declined to approximately 15% in the BAU scenario.

```

In the Williams Lake TSA, the amount of early seral forest decreased to 0 in the HEWSR at 25 years into the future under all scenarios, but in the BAU scenario the amount increased to 12% at year 80 (Fig. 4). In the BC and ECCC scenarios, the amount of early seral forest in LESR, LEWR and Matrix decreased to 0. However, in the BAU scenario the amount of early seral forest decreased in the first 30 years, but then increased again over time in the LESR, LEWR and Matrix habitat types.

Under the ECCC and BC scenarios we saw that forestry activity was displaced to other caribou herds' critical habitat where no constraints were applied. For example, we saw that in the Quesnel TSA that the proportion of early seral forest increased in Barkerville HEWSR 5 years earlier in ECCC and BC scenarios compared to the BAU scenario (Fig. 5). The proportion of early seral forest in Barkerville matrix habitat increased 5 years earlier and increased 5% higher in the ECCC and BC scenarios compared to the BAU scenario.

#### Adjacency = 1.5 m and Recovery = 30 Years
In the scenarios with a 1.5 m adjacency constraint and 30 year recovery period, the amount of early seral forest was similar in all scenarios and critical habtiat types in the Quesnel TSA  (Fig. 6). All scenarios saw an increase in early seral forest in LESR and LEWR habtiat at approximately 85 years into the future. There was also an increase in early seral forest in LEWR habitat early in the scenario. In all scenarios there was now change in HEWSR habitat, and a steady decrease in early seral forest in matrix habitat.

```{r, FIG 6, Area LT40 Quesnel a15y30, echo = F, error = F, eval = T, include = T, message = F, warning = F}

  scale_color_discrete (name = "Scenario", labels = c("BAU", "BC Herd Plan", "ECCC"))  

```

Similarly, in the Williams Lake TSA, he amount of early seral forest was similar in all scenarios (Fig. 7). The general pattern was a decrease in early seral forest in HEWSR and Matrix critical habitat, and a highly cyclical, although overall decreasing trend in  early seral forest in LESR and LEWR habitat.

#### BAU and BC Herd Plan Scenario Comparisons
When comparing adjacency and recovery constraints across scenarios in the Quesnel TSA, we found that the BAU with 3m adjacency and 40 year recovery time resulted in the highest proprotion of early seral forest in LESR and LEWR over the longest period of time (Fig. 8). However, this scenario resulted in an intermediate amount of early seral forest in Matrix habitat. Not surprisingly, the BC herd plan scenario with a 3 m adjacency and 40 year recovery period resulted in the greatest reddcution of early seral forest in LESR, LEWR and Matrix critical habitat types. Interestingly, the BC herd plan and BAU scenarios converged when the adjaceny constraint was set to 1.5 m and the recovery period was set to 30 years. Also interesting was that each combination of adjacency and recovery time had a unique effect on where forest harvest occurred. The most 'constrained' scenario (BC Herd Plan, 3m, 40 years) reduced the amount of early seral forest in all critical habitat types.  However, the BAU scenario with restrictive adjacency (3 m) and conservative habitat recovery (40 years) resulted in the greatest amount of early seral forest in LESR and LEWR habitat for the longest period of time. The sceanrios with less restrictive adjacency (1.5 m) and faster habitat recovery (30 years) maintainted a relatively low amount of early seral forest in LESR habitat for the majority of the simulation period, and an intermediate amount of early seral forest in LEWR habitat. These scenarios allowed for the highest amount of early seral forest in matrix habitat, but the trend was declining throughout the simulation period. 

```{r, FIG 8, Area LT40 Quesnel scenario compare, echo = F, error = F, eval = T, include = T, message = F, warning = F}

```

In the Williams Lake TSA, all scenarios followed a similar declining trajectory in the amount of early seral forest in all critical habitat types for the first 25 years of the simulation (Fig. 9). The most restrictive scenario (BAU, 3m adjacency, 40 year recovery) maintained a very low level of early seral forest in critical habitat thoruoguth the simualtion. In the BAU scenario with restrictive adjacency and conservative habitat recovery, the amount of early seral forest increased the most in HEWSR and LESR habitat, especially later in the simulation. The BC herd plan and BAU scenarios with a 1.5 m adjacency and 30 year habitat recovery allowed for an intermediate amount of early seral forest in HESR and LESR habtiat types, and slightly more in the LEWR and Matrix habtait types compared to other scenarios.

### Fire
We found that the average area of less than 40 year old burns in each caribou critical habtiat type was low, i.e., up to 2,000 ha or 1% of the critical habitat area (Table 3). However, burns were an episodic event, and in some years the percentatge of area of less than 40 year old burns was much larger, i.e., up to 6% in HEWSR, 14% in LEWR, 18% in LESR and 36% in Matrix habitat. Although on average fire disturbance was low, periodic fire events significantly increased the area disturbed in a short period of time.

```{r, table 3, fire, echo = F, error = F, eval = T, include = T, message = F, warning = F}

Our approach to estimating fire disturbance was simplistic but informative. Fire histories across caribou herds and critical habitat types indicated that fire was highly cyclical. In general, there was a period of relatively regular and large fires in the early 1900's, until the 1960's or 1970's, at which point the frequency and size of fires decreased, perhaps as fire suppresion became more effective. Thus, the area of less than 40 year old burns was declining over recent decades. However, more recently, in some caribou ranges, including the Itcha-Ilgachuz, there were large fires, suddenly increasing the amount of disturbance in caribou critical habitat types. Two important considerations with our approach are that we estimated the area of fire disturbance using burn perimeters, which likely included unburned areas, and we did not calculate fire disturbance exclusive of other overlapping disturbance types (e.g., cublocks). Thus, we likely overestimated the area burned in each critical habitat type. Future work on CLUS will improve how fire is accounted for and simulated. 

## Conclusions
We found that compared to a BAU scenario, the BC herd plan and ECCC recovery strategy scenarios reduced annual harvest in the CLUS model by up to approximately 350,000m^3^, or 15%. These scenarios also had the desired effect of reducing the amount of early seral forest in the Itcha-Ilgachuz critical habitat types. However, the effects of these sceanrios, on timber harvest in TSAs, and early seral forest in caribou critical habtiat types, varied substantially depending on the adjacency constraint and habitat recovery time period implemented in the model. Thus, our results suggest that how we manage forest harvest within and outside of caribou critical habitat (i.e., beyond matrix habitat), such as adjacency requirements, has significant implications for timber harvest and caribou habitat. They also show that there is value in investing in rapid, large-scale habitat recovery. Using the CLUS tool to facilitate a detailed discussion on caribou habitat recovery with local foresters and wildlife biologists, and forestry companies operating in the region is recommended. 

Our modelling approach emphasizes the importance of considering factors beyond a 'disturbance' management threshold in caribou habitat recovery. The disturbance threshold  does not capture the complexities of caribou habitat recovery. For example, the indicator does not distinguish between the effects of roads or cutblocks on caribou, or different forest stand recovery trajectories on moose forage. The lack of recovery of historic roads in our model scenarios make it nearly impossible for disturbance to recover in the future in many caribou critical habitat types. Using a single age threshold to manage and model cariobu habitat is limiting. Our results show that a more detailed discussion on the definition of recovered caribou habitat is needed to create more realistic and optimistic CLUS model scenarios and caribou recovery plans. 
   
Our results also emphasize the importance of managing caribou critical habitat at large scales. We found that applying critical habitat constraints exclusively to the Itcha-Ilgachuz herd displaced disturbance to the critical habitat of other caribou herds in a TSA (e.g., Barkerville). Thus, even herds that are not adjacent or ecologically connected are not necessarily independent in terms of forest management. Ultimately, forest harvest in caribou critical habitat should be managed across multiple herds in the same TSA.
