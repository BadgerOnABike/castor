## Introduction
Here we report on caribou habitat management scenarios developed for the Itcha-Ilgachuz caribou herd recovery plan. We took habitat managment scenarios developed by Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) and British Columbia (BC) and comapred them to a 'business-as-usal' scenario in a cariobu and land use simulator (CLUS). Sceanrios were implemented in CLUS as contraints on forestry developement, i.e., limits on forestry activity within defined cariobu cirtical habtait areas. Below we decribe the general methods implemented the model, results of model ouptus and a 


## Methods
We use the CLUS model to simulate forest harvest on a landscape and estimate timber harvest flow, i.e., annual cut, and cariobu habtiat value over space and time. CLUS is a spatial-temporal forest havest and caribou indicator model. It mirrors models developed for timber supply reviews (TSRs), but integrates them with caribou habitat models and indicators. It uses the [provincial forest inventory](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/vri-2019-forest-vegetation-composite-layer-1-l1-) on the state of the forest and road data developed for the provincial cumulative effects program as key inputs. In addition, it implements existing constraints on forest harvest on the land base, i.e., the timber harvest land base (THLB), [government actions regualtion (GAR) orders](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/natural-resource-stewardship/laws-policies-standards-guidance/legislation-regulation/forest-range-practices-act/government-actions-regulation), [visual quality objectives](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/forestry/managing-our-forest-resources/visual-resource-management), [old growth management areas (OGMAs)](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/old-growth-management-areas-legal-current) and [biodiversity emphasis options (BEOs)](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/landscape-units-of-british-columbia-all).  

CLUS is flexible in its scale. Fundamentally it simulates forestry at a minimum within a timber supply area (TSA), and where possible a supply block within a TSA, but it can simulate all TSAs that overlap a caribou herd, because it applies common data and assumptions across TSA's. For each TSA independently, the model harvests timber annually with the objective of achieving the current legislated [allowable annual cut (AAC)](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/forestry/managing-our-forest-resources/timber-supply-review-and-allowable-annual-cut).  

This analysis includes the Quesnel and Williams Lake TSA's which overlap with the majority of the Itcha-Ilgachuz herds. A small portion of the herd occurs in the Prince George TSA, but that was not included in the scenario becuase of its small size relative to the TSA (<5%?). The CLUS model simulates the harvest of live trees only. Thus, it may underestimate the impact of forestry on caribou where there is significant harvest of dead volume. Our assumption is that the AAC uplift to harvest dead mountain pine beetle stands is reaching an end, an assumption evident in soem recent AAC determination (e.g., see [Morice TSA](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/farming-natural-resources-and-industry/forestry/stewardship/forest-analysis-inventory/tsr-annual-allowable-cut/morice_tsa_rationale.pdf) and [Prince George TSA](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/farming-natural-resources-and-industry/forestry/stewardship/forest-analysis-inventory/tsr-annual-allowable-cut/2017flnr0325-001717.pdf)). The AAC of live volume in the [Quesnel TSA was set at 1,250,000m^3^ in 2017](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/forestry/managing-our-forest-resources/timber-supply-review-and-allowable-annual-cut/allowable-annual-cut-timber-supply-areas/quesnel-tsa) and in the [Williams Lake TSA was set at 1,500,000m^3^ in 2015](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/forestry/managing-our-forest-resources/timber-supply-review-and-allowable-annual-cut/allowable-annual-cut-timber-supply-areas/williams-lake-tsa).  

It is important to note that CLUS is not an exact copy of TSR models used to establish AAC's. Rather, it follows similar logic and assumptions, but because it is not the exact same it may or may not achieve a legally established AAC target.  Thus, scenarios need to be considered in the context of timber flow estiamted in a BAU scenario, and not against a legislated AAC. 

CLUS is implemented using the [R programming language](https://www.R-project.org/) and all code to run the model is posted in the BC government [github repository](https://github.com/bcgov/clus) following all requirenemnts and guidelines. 

### Scenarios
We implemented three sceanrios in CLUS:
1. Business as Usual (BAU)
2. ECCC Recovery Strategy
3. BC Itcha-Ilgachuz Herd Plan 

The BAU scenario implements the model with current, existing legal constraints (see above). The ECCC and BC scenarios implement additional constraints on caribou critical habitat types (Table 1). Critical habitat areas were spatially defined by BC government caribou biologists with expertise working in the Itcha-Ilgachuz herd range. Details on these contraints are described in teh *Key Model Assumptions*, below. 

```{r, table 1, scenarios, echo = F, error = F, eval = T, include = F, message = F}

table.scenarios = data.table(
  constraint = c ("HEWR", "HESR", "LEWR", "LESR", "Matrix", "Cutblock Recovery", "Road Recovery", "500m Buffer"),

            fixed_small_size = T)

```

### Key Model Parameters
Below we highlight some of the key parameters in the model, as they have improtant implications in the CLUS model, and thus CLUS outputs and results should be interpreted within the context of these parameters. 

#### Constraint Types
The ECCC and BC plans use the spatial critical habitat data developed by the BC government. These critical habitat types are high elevation winter range (HEWR), high elevation summer range (HESR), which are grouped together in the Itcha-Ilgchuz herd range as high elevation winter and summer range (HEWSR), low elevation winter range (LEWR), low elevation summer range (LESR) and matrix. Within each of those types a constraint on 'disturbance' is applied, and there are two types of contraints: no disturbance and 35% disturbance. 'No disturbance' areas are essentially caribou-specific protected areas, that restrict any forestry, or other types of development. The 35% distruabcne threshold was selected based on a model developed by [ECCC for boreal caribou](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/species-risk-public-registry/related-information/boreal-caribou-science-summary.html). The model related disturbance, estimated as the area of non-overlapping fire and anthropogenic disturbance (e.g., cutblocks, roads, seismic lines, mapped usign sateliite imagery) buffered by 500 m, to caribou calf recruitment rate (Fig. 1), and then used this model to estimate the probability that a caribou popaultion trend (\( \lambda \)) is greater or equal to one as the area disturbed changes (Fig. 2).


```{r FIG 1 calf - disturb, echo = F, message = F, eval = T, fig.cap = "Figure 1. Modelled relationship between boreal caribou calf recruitment rate and habitat disturbance. Source: https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/species-risk-public-registry/related-information/boreal-caribou-science-summary.html", fig.width = 1, fig.height = 3}
knitr::include_graphics( here ("reports/scenarios/images", "eccc_recruit_disturb_fig.jpg"))
```


```{r FIG 2 lambda - disturb, echo = F, message = F, eval = T, fig.cap = "Figure 2. Modelled relationship between boreal caribou popualtion trend (lambda) and habitat disturbance. Source: https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/species-risk-public-registry/related-information/boreal-caribou-science-summary.html", fig.width = 1, fig.height = 3}
knitr::include_graphics( here ("reports/scenarios/images", "eccc_lambda_disturb_fig.jpg"))
```


The [ECCC recovery strategy for southern mountain caribou](https://www.registrelep-sararegistry.gc.ca/virtual_sara/files/plans/rs_woodland_caribou_bois_s_mtn_pop_0114_e.pdf) adopted this model for establishing limits to disturbance in certain soutehrn mountain caribou critical habitat types (Table 1). While this model is useful because it establishes a linkage between habitat and caribou populations, there are important things to consider when using it. First, managing disturbance as a strategy to manage caribou habitat is a 'blunt instrument'. It limits our ability to model more direct and specific forest management actions, including, for example, the amount of forest harvest versus road disturbance in caribou range. Second, because it lumps all disturbance types (e.g., cutblocks, roads, fire) together, it doesn't indciate how these different types may be influecing cariobu habtait, which is improtant, because cutblocks and roads affect cariobu differently (e.g., [DeCesare et al. 2010](https://scholarworks.umt.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1016&context=wildbio_pubs)). Third, the model was developed for boreal caribou, which live in very different habitat and have very different behaviours. 

#### Fire
The CLUS model does not currently simulate fire into the future. Thus, we incorporate fire into the disturbance as a *post-hoc* analysis. We calculated the amount of area of <40 year old burns in each critical habitat type. We then calculated the distribution and median of the area of <40 year old burns over the past 40 years. This data can then be used to determine how much additional disturbance could occur from fire, in addition to forestry.  

We found that in general the average area of less than 40 year old burns in each habtiat type was low, i.e., up to 2,000 ha or 1% of the herd area (Table 2). However, fire is an episodic event, and in some years the area of less than 40 year old burns was large, i.e., 6% in HEWSR, 14% in LEWR, 18% in LESR and 36% in matrix. Managing fire disturbance in caribou range will likely be a challenge, because although on average fire disturbance may be low, periodic fire events will signficantly increase the area disturbed in a short period of time.

```{r, table 2, fire, echo = F, error = F, eval = T, include = F, message = F}
table.fire = data.table(
  habiat_type = c ("HEWSR",  "LEWR", "LESR", "Matrix"),
  med_area_ha = c (1208, 213, 2009, 137),
  max_area_ha = c (9029, 101034, 38829, 314797),
  min_area_ha = c ("2", "<1", "1", "<1"),
  med_perc = c ("1", "<1", "1", "<1"),
  max_perc = c (6, 14, 18, 36),
  min_prec = c ("<1", "<1", "<1", "<1")
)

kable (table.fire,
       caption = "<b>Table 2. Area Burned in a 40 Year Period in Itcha-Ilgachuz Caribou Herd Critical Habitats.<b>",
       col.names = c("Habitat Type",
                     "Average Area (ha)",
                     "Maximum Area (ha)",
                     "Minimum Area (ha)",
                     "Average Percent Area",
                     "Maximum Percent Area",
                     "Minimum Percent Area"),
       format.args = list (big.mark = ","),
       align = rep( c('l', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c'))) %>%
  kable_styling (position = "left",
                 bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"),
                 fixed_thead = T,
                 full_width = F,
                 font_size = 11) %>%
  footnote (general = "HEWSR = high elevation winter and summer range; LEWR = low elevation winter range; LESR = low elevation summer range",
            fixed_small_size = T)
```

This approach to estimating fire disturbance is simplistic and has two key considerations. First, fire histories across cariobu herds and critical habtait types indicate that fire is highly cylcical. In general, there was a period of relatively regular and large fires in the early 1900's, until the 1960's or 1970's, at which point the frequency and size of fire decreased as fire suppresion becaame effective. Thus the area of <40 year old burns was slowly declining. However, more recently, in some caribou ranges including the Itch-Ilgachuz, there has been large fires. Thus the are of burn disturabnce shoudl be viewed as highly cyclical, with peridos of very high fire distruabcen followed by lengthy periods of habtait recovery. However, we caution that this trend may not continue into the future given climate cahnge. A second consideraiton is that we measured firte distruabce usign burn perimters, and thus we are overestimatign the area burned, as many areas within a perimeter may not be burned. Third, we did not cauclate fire distruabnce excolusive of other distuabcne types (e.g., cublocks). Thus, we are overestimating the area of distrubance form bursn. 

In summary, our appraoch overestimated fire disturbance on average, and failed to account for the cyclical nature of fire disturbance. Future work on CLUS will improve how fire is accounted for and simulated. 

#### Road and Cutblock Recovery
In these scenarios, the CLUS model considers 1 to 40 year old cutblocks as disturbance. At 40 years, a cutblock is no longer considered as distrubance adn is removed form teh disturabnce calccualtion. Cutblock recovery at 40 years, because that is a general heuristic used to define early seral forest. However, the ECCC distruabcne model did not assess forest stand age and habtait recovery, cutblocks were estimated based on visual interpretation of imagery. Furthmreo, forest stand age is not an ideal measure for standa charactericsits. Early seral forest standas are considered a thretat to cariobu becuase they provide forage for moose (i.e., shrbs), which can potentially increase moose and wolf density in cariobu ranges. FOrest age does not necessarily accurately represent shrub cover, e.g., some stands will mature faster or slower than 40 years, depdning on site prodcutivity. There is some evidence that moose prefer 10 to 30 year old stands in some part of BC ( [Poole and Stuart-Smith 2004](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kim_Poole/publication/228974009_Winter_habitat_selection_by_moose_in_the_East_Kootenay_British_Columbia_final_report/links/55bbdc0708ae092e9660b312.pdf), [Schneideman 2018](http://web.unbc.ca/~michael/Pubs/Matt%20Scheideman%20Thesis%20Final%20for%20distribution.pdf)). This parameter is likely influential on teh model and requires careful consideration based on loal knowledge of stand cahracteristics as they realte to moose forage.   

In these scenarios, teh CLUS model does not recover roads, rather, they are treated as permanet features. Theereofre they have a signfiant inlfuence on the disturabnce cauclation and will incrasingly limit forest harvest in areas as the amount of roads built to harvest an are increases. It may be helpful to include some form of road recovery in future scnearios. There is very litle sceince on how road reveory might influence cariobu. Much of the reasrch on lieanr features has focussed on seismic lines in eth boreal forest. However, a road recovery apramter coudl be developed with the assumption that road recovery is achievable within a certain time frame. 

#### Cutblock Adjacency
Foresty was simulated with adjacency constraints, i.e., a forest stand can only be cut adjacent to a forest stand that has acheieved a height of 5 m. This adjacency constraint can be removed to allow more flexibility in where the model can harvest. Removing this constraint can result in the creation of large continous cutblocks. 

## Results
AS expected, the BAU scenario had the highest annual timber harvest, but lowest indicators of caribou survival. However, the ECCC and BC herd plan sceanrio had similar results.

### Modeled Annual Harvest Volume
Over a 100 year period, the CLUS model harvested 241,955,640m^3^ in the BAU scenario, compared to 207,595,104m^3^ in the BC herd plan scenario and 205,793,848m^3^ in the ECCC scenario (Table 3). Thus, averaged over a 100 years period, the recovery scenarios reduced the harvest by 14% and 15%, respectively. Note that the BAU scenario was able to achieve the live volume AAC of 2,750,000m^3^ in 50% of the 100 years, whereas the BC herd plan and ECCC scenarios achieved the AAC in 33% and 32$ of years, respectively.  

```{r, table 3, results, echo = F, error = F, eval = T, include = F, message = F}
table.volume = data.table(
  scenario = c ("BAU", "BC Herd Plan", "ECCC Recovery Strategy"),
  tot_volume = c (241955640, 207595104, 205793848),

            fixed_small_size = T)
```

### Actual Harvested Volume
Recent harvest in the Quesnel and Williams Lake TSA's has been below the current AAC in those units (Fig. 3). Annual harvest in 2019 was at approximately 58% and 54% of the AAC in the William's Lake and Quesnel TSA's, respectively. Much of this decline may be due to a reduction in harvest of dead stands, as mountain pine beetle killed stands have been harvested in response to previous AAC uplifts to harvest those stands.

```

### Early Seral Forest Indicator
The amount of early seral forest (i.e., forest stands less than 40 years old) did not change among the scenarios in the HEWSR in the Quesnel TSA (Fig. 4). However, under the BAU scenario, the amount of early seral forest increased up to approximately 10% of area in the LESR and up to 25% in the LEWR at approximately 40 years into the future (Fig. 3). In all sceanrios, the proportion of early seral forest decreased in matrix habitat, however, it declined to less than 5% in approxiamtely 35 years in the BC and ECCC plans, and declined to approximately 15% in the BAU scenario.

```{r, FIG 4, Area LT40 Quesnel, echo = F, error = F, eval = T, include = F, message = F}
data.surv <- read.csv (here ("reports/scenarios/data", "survival.csv"))
data.surv <- data.surv %>%
              filter (scenario == "bau" | scenario == "bc_herd_plan" | scenario == "eccc") %>%
              filter (herd_bounds == "Itcha-Ilgachuz HEWSR" | herd_bounds == "Itcha-Ilgachuz LESR" |
                      herd_bounds == "Itcha-Ilgachuz LEWR" | herd_bounds == "Itcha-Ilgachuz Matrix")
data.surv.ques <- data.surv %>%

  scale_color_discrete (name = "Scenario", labels = c("BAU", "BC Herd Plan", "ECCC"))  

```

The amount of early seral forest decreased to 0 in the HEWSR at 25 years into the future under all scenarios, but in the BAU scenario the amount increased again to approximately 3% at year 25, and 12% at year 80 (Fig. 5). In the BC and ECCC scenarios, the amount of early seral forest in LESR, LEWR and Matrix decreased to 0. However, in teh BAU scenario the amount of early seral forest decreased in the first 30 years, but then increased again over time in the LESR, LEWR and Matrix habitat types.

### Disturbance Indicator
Initially (i.e., at year 0 of the simulation) in the portion of Itcha-Ilgachuz herd in the Quesnel TSA, disturbance was very low (close to 0%) in HEWSR habitat, at approximately 20% in LESR habitat, approximately 25% in LEWR habitat and high (approximately 65%) matrix habitat (Fig. 6). Disturbance essentially did not change in HEWSR under any scenario. Under the BAU scenario, disturbance in LESR habitat increased to approximately 60% at year 50 and then stabilized. In LEWR habitat disturbance increased to approximately 50% at year 5, and then increased again to approximately 80% at year 50 and then stabilized. In Matrix habitat, disturbance increased to approximately 80% at year 10 and then essentially stabilized. 

Under the BC herd plan scenario, disturbance increased in LESR habitat to approximately 45% at year 30 and then stabilized. In LEWR habitat disturbance increased to approximately 30% at year 5, and then stabilized. In Matrix habitat, disturbance essentially stabilized at approximately 65%.

Under the ECCC scenario, disturbance stabilized in LESR habitat at approximately 20%. Similarly, in LEWR habitat disturbance slowly declined from approximately 25% to 20%. In Matrix habitat, disturbance declined from approximately 65% to 55% over the course of the scenario.

Initially (i.e., at year 0 of the simulation) in the portion of Itcha-Ilgachuz herd in the Williams Lake TSA, disturbance was very low (close to 0%) in HEWSR habitat, at approximately 45% in LESR habitat, approximately 70% in LEWR habitat and approximately 75% in matrix habitat (Fig. 7). Disturbance did not change in the HEWSR under the BC herd plan or ECCC scenario's, but increased to close to 70% at year 75 under the BAU scenario. Under the BAU scenario, disturbance in LESR habitat increased to approximately 75% at year 75 and then stabilized. In LEWR adn Matrix habitats, disturbance increased relatively steadily to approximately 85% and 80%, respectively.

Under the BC herd plan and ECCC scenarios, disturbance decreased in LESR habitat to approximately 40% at year 25 and then stabilized. In LEWR habitat disturbance decreased to approximately 70% at year 25, and then stabilized. In Matrix habitat, these two sceanrios divirged slightly. Under the BC herd plan scenario, disturbance was essentially stable at 75% and under the ECCC scenario, disturabcne declined to just less than 70% and stabilized at yar 25.

Under the BC herd plan and ECCC scenarios, we saw that distubance was displaced to herds where no new protections (as defined in the sceanrios) were implemented. For example, distubance was 20% higher between 25 and 35 years into the future in Barkerville HEWSR habitat under the BC herd plan and ECCC scenarios compared to the BAU scenario (Fig. 8). Similarly, distubance was 10% higher between 25 and 35 years into the future in Barkerville matrix habitat under the BC herd plan and ECCC scenarios compared to the BAU scenario

## Conclusions
We found that the effects of the BC herd plan and ECCC scenarios reduced annual harvest in the CLUS model by approximately 350,000m^3^, or 15% from the BAU scenario. These scearnis also had teh desried effect fo redcutign teh amoutn of early seral forest and disturabnce in teh Itcha-Ilgachuz criticla habitat types. These effects were aprticualrly strogn in th LEWR critical habtiat in teh Quesenl TSA adn LESR in the Williams lake TSA. Notably, tehre was little difference between teh BC herd plan and ECCC sceanrios in terms of timber harvest or cariobu indicators. Thsi was likely because of the reatlively high disturabnce levels already in the LESR, LEWR adn particualrly Matrix habitats. Harvest was seevrely limtied in tehse areas because tehya were already at or close to the thresholds used to contraint forestry. Our results highlight the challenge with recovering habtiat in teh Itcha-Ilgachuz herd range. However, our moelling appraoh also highlights the limtiatiosn with using a caorse measure of didtriabnces as a management threshold. While the distruabnce model is useful to provide a corse indication of habtiat conditojns, it does not capture the complexities of cariobu habtiat recovery, particualry as they realte to predatin. The indicator does distibnugish between teh efefcts of roads or cutblocsk, and teh reeocvery of forest stands is very general and perhaps conseravtive. More detail on how these habitats can be recovered, adn managemtn thresholds for scpeific habtait recvoery coudl paint a more optimisitic picture of habtait recoefy for cariobu. In particualr, the lack of recovery of roads in our model scenarios make it nearly impossible for forest haervest to occur in teh future many cariobu critival habtait types. 

Our resutsl also highlight the improtant issue of displacing disturabnce when considerign teh recovery of single caribou herds in isolation of other nearby herds. Even herds that are not adjacent or ecological contiguos are not necessarily inddpendent in terms of forest managment. Incrfeasign protectiosn in one range can displace distruabcne to otehr ranges. Ultimately, the effect of recoveing multiple herds on timber supply will not be lienar as more herds are ptoected.   

The Itcha-Ilgachuz has highlighted imrptoant issues that we will explore in other scenarios. In particular, we will model the recovery of roads adn cutblocks at 40 years to assess how road recvoery coudl improve forest harvest while maitnatining low disturabmnce. We will also model a sceanrio wehre cutblocsk and roads recover at 30 years, to assess how measures to accerlerate habitat recvoery might influence timber harvest. Finally, we will model teh same scanrio as modelled here for teh Barkerwille and Wells Gray North cariobu herds, to esplore how these thresholds influence forest harvest adn cariobu indicaotrs in areas with different levesl of habtait disturbance form teh Itcha-Ilgachuz herd range.
