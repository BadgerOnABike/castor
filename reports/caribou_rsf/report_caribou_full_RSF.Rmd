## Introduction
The conservation and recovery of caribou popualtiosn across British Columbia (BC) has become an urgent prioirty for the provincal government and the government of Canada. The provincal governemtn recently supported a five year, $50 million program to corrdinate adn facilitate recovery actiosn across teh province. Integral to this program are decision support tools to help decision makers underatnd the implcaiitosn or alternative recovery actions. 

Decision support tools are infraomtion and models that represent factors of interest to decision makers. Specifically, these tools are being developed as a caribou and land use simulator (CLUS). The CLUS directly supports decision makers by providing spatial information (i.e., data and maps) on the current condition of the landscape (specifically, caribou habitat and populations and natural resource development), but more importantly, information on how future land use and climate change influences landscape condition. It will be used to help quantify, visualize and provide bounds to how alternate caribou recovery actions applied to an area (e.g., a group of caribou herds) could influence the future status of caribou and economic development in that area. The compoents of the CLUS are  transparent (i.e., available to the public), mathematical models (i.e., a documented, scientifically supported representation of reality using numbers and equations). These models reprsetn our undersadtning of ecology adn natural reorce development in a simplistic but useful way for supproting decision making. The CLUS model will allow decision makers to try out different management options (e.g., forest practices policies and habitat protection) before putting them into practice and identify those that achieve the desired balance between caribou recovery and economic costs and benefits. It helps improve the decision maker’s confidence in their decision by helping them understand the implications of alternative decisions, and the public’s confidence that the decision was based on a rational consideration of alternatives. 

Here I develop the cariobu habitat model component of the CLUS. The habitat model was developed using a resource selection function (RSF) and model selection process approach.  RSFs were calculated for three seasons (early winter, late winter and summer), and across four caribou designatable units (DUs), i.e., ecological designations, of caribou. Caribou DU's  in British Columbia include DU 6 (boreal), DU7 (northern mountain), DU8 (central mountain) and DU9 (sourthern mountain) [see COSEWIC 2011](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/eccc/migration/cosewic-cosepac/4e5136bf-f3ef-4b7a-9a79-6d70ba15440f/cosewic_caribou_du_report_23dec2011.pdf). I had data that estimated measures of caribou habitat features (covaraites) at approximately 500,000 caribou telemetry locations collected across Brtisish Columbia, and approximately two million randomly sampled locations within caribou home ranges (i.e., 'available' locations). Cariobu selection of these habtait features was tested by formulating RSF models consisting of different combinatiosn of habtait covariates. Each RSF model reprsents a differetn hypothesis of habtiat features that influence cariobu. These hypotheses are coamrped in a model selection appraoch using Akaike's Infomation Criterion (AIC), and soem consdieation of their ability to predict cariobu occurence. 

The 'hyptohesis' consisted of the follwong models:
- terrain adn water (soil parent amterail, lakes, watercoruses, eleavtion, aspect adn slope); cariobu are infleunced by 'enduring' features of teh ladnscape and/or these features represent or are proxies for a wide range of habtait featrues imprtoant to cariobu (food, predation risk, etc.)   
- forestry disturabnce (distance to cubtlocks of variaous age and different road types); well documented that cariobu distirbution and survical are inlfuenced by forestry activity, either as disturabnce or likely through predation meachnisms
- agricultural distruabnce (distance to agricultrual areas and different road types); likely contributes to predation mechanism; ag lands highly provudctive for ungualtes
- mine disturbance (distance to mines and different road types); highly modifed/disturbed ladnscape; cariobu shoudl avoid
- energy disturabnce; (distance to pipeliens and wells, sesimic lines and different road types); highly modifed/disturbed ladnscape; improtant preation mechanism, partiucalrly in boreal
- all human distruabnce (all huan distruabce covarties listed above); test whether all covaraites togetehr improve model fit
- 'natural' distruabce (burns adn beetles); natural distruabcen affects forest succesiion, early seral, which impacts food for ungulate sand predators; cariobu may avoid
- annual cliamte (temp, ppt, etc.); measures of climate taken over an annual period; long-term dirvers of habtiat
- seasonal climate; with lags?; measure sof climate over teh saeson that the cariobu occurred at those locations; shorter term dirvers of habtiat
- landcover (wetland (boreal only), bec, vri.....); broad classes of habitat; likely represent imprtoatn asptects fo food and predation
- forest stand (.....)


- combos of the above

- build a 'table' of these by DU/season; combos may vary by DU




## Methods
RSF models are a form of binomial logistic regression models that are used to statistically estimate habitat selection by animals (Boyce et al. 1999; Manly et al. 2007).


AIC is a model selction method, where models are ranked based on their fit to the data (log-likelihood) and the numebr of covaraites in teh model (Bunrham adn Anderson 2002). Models are penalzied for having more covaraites (i.e., are more complex).  


### Seasons
Data were split into 3 seasons, based on lit. review (see caariobu seasosn spreadsheet):
 calving/summer/fall	(summer) = 15-May to 31-Oct 
early winter =	01-Nov	to 15-Jan
late winter	= 16-Jan to 14-May

### GIS data
- CE data
  - roads: paved adn 'resoruce road' types


### Data Exploration
Did series of data visualtizatiosn to explore data for anamolies, potential issues with aplying regression mdoel and also better undersatdn potantil realtionships between covariates (Zuur et al. 2010)
 
First, looked for outliers using a bxolpot
 
```{r, boxplot data exploration, eval = F, echo = T}
ggplot (rsf.data.terrain.water.du6.ew, aes (x = pttype, y = elevation)) +
        geom_boxplot (outlier.colour = "red") +
        labs (title = "Boxplot DU6, Early Winter Elevation at Available (0) and Used (1) Locations",
              x = "Available (0) and Used (1) Locations",
              y = "Elevation")
```
 

Then looked at distbituion of data using hisotograms
```{r, histogram data exploration, eval = F, echo = T}
ggplot (rsf.data.terrain.water.du6.ew, aes (x = elevation, fill = pttype)) + 
        geom_histogram (position = "dodge", binwidth = 25) +
        labs (title = "Histogram DU6, Early Winter Elevation at Available (0) and Used (1) Locations",
              x = "Elevation",
              y = "Count") +
        scale_fill_discrete (name = "Location Type")
```

Then looked for corraltion using spearman correaltion analysis and plots 

I then tested for correlation between these covariates using a Spearman-rank ($\rho$) correlation and by calculating variance inflation factors (VIFs) from GLMs. If covariates had a $\rho$ > 0.7 or VIF > 10 (Montgomery and Peck 1992; Manly et al. 2007; DeCesare et al. 2012), then a covariate was removed from analysis. VIFs were calculated using the vif() function from the 'car' package in R. 


```{r, correlation plot, eval = F, echo = T}
corr.terrain.water.du6.ew <- rsf.data.terrain.water.du6.ew [c (10:15)]
corr.terrain.water.du6.ew <- round (cor (corr.terrain.water.du6.ew, method = "spearman"), 3)
ggcorrplot (corr.terrain.water.du6.ew, type = "lower", lab = TRUE, tl.cex = 10,  lab_size = 3,
            title = "Terrain and Water Resource Selection Function Model
            Covariate Correlations for DU6, Early Winter")
```


and coreatlions  variance inflation factors (VIFs) from 'car' package based on a simple glm
```{r, glm and vifs, eval = F, echo = T}
glm.terrain.du6.ew <- glm (pttype ~ elevation + easting + northing + slope + distance_to_lake +
                                     distance_to_watercourse + soil_parent_material_name, 
                            data = rsf.data.terrain.water.du6.ew,
                            family = binomial (link = 'logit'))
car::vif (glm.terrain.du6.ew)
```



### Fitting Models

- first, reviewed recent literature, herd plans, talked to regioanl biolgoists to get an undrstading of cariobu ecology in a DU

- used this to subset soem fo teh potential GIS covaiatres based on DU ecology

- random efefct for idnvidual cariobu/year (Mumma et al. 2018; Demars 2018)


- covaraites tdandardized ((x-mean) / sd) to help with model convergence and simplify interepretation of relative effects of covariates


- compared models using AIC

- fit models with random efefcts (inercept for each unique indivudal and year, adn fixed efefcts for continouts and categoriacla covaraites, random efefcts account for indivdual anaimal variability and a random sampel of the popautlion; fixed efefcts are the popautliomn efefct, estiametd with random invidail varaition in sample accounted for in the model

- first fit terrain, vegetation, climate, huamn disturbnce, natural disturbnce specific-models, most fit all comibnatiosn fo models, for vegetation, used groups of ladncover and BEC, food and forest stand characteristics together and tested models with combinations of these three covariate sets

- also looked at specific covaraites; if were non-sensical based on ecological understadnign than removed them. for example, in du6, early winter, found selection for locatiosn closer to mines; no ecological itnerpretation for why, so removed. conversely, ambiguous whetehr cariobu select for cutblocks (food) or aovid (predation risk), so kept these covaites, 


#### key poitns from workshops with reagional biologists

  - Endurign features top-ranked model included slope, disatnce to lake, and soil type and had an AIC weight (AIC*~w~*) of 0.511. The second ranked model included all covariates (elevation, slope, disatnce to lake, disatnce to watercourse, soil type) and had an AIC weight (AIC*~w~*) of 0.489 ; . coefficent values of covairaets  for these two models were nearly ideantical, tehrefore all covaraites were reatined for further consideration

- correlations
  - disatcne to agriculure highly correalted with disatnce to paved raoads ($\rho$ = 0.70) and some       cutblock ages ($\rho$ > 0.73), thus dropped that covariate
  - disatnce to pipeline adn distance to well highly correlated ($\rho$ = 0.74); dropped well because     mecahims of predation is via linear features; likely larger imapct than wells on cariobu 

![](plots/corr_human_dist.png)

- highest vif value was 3.56
 
  - Human disturbance features top-ranked model (AIC*~w~* 0.708) included the distance to cutblock covaraites, distance to road covariates and distance to mine. The second ranked model included the same covariates, and a covariate for distance to pipeline,  and had an AIC*~w~* = 0.270.  Coefficent values of covairaets  for these two models were nearly ideantical, tehrefore ratehr than take average of each model, I used the model that included the seismic line covaraite rather tahn average models

###### Natural Disturbance

  - kept height, crown closure, bryoid cover, herb cover, stand age, and shrub crown

  - fit candidate models with wetland and BEC classes only (base model), and added food (shurb, 
    bryoids adn herbs), and forest stand cahracteristics (age, height + crown closure) for 
    comaprison

  - used wetland cover classes instead of VRI cover classes for DU6 because of precedent (Demars)

- vif values were less than 3.24

- the top model included all covariates (AIC*~w~* = 1.00), and therefore all covraites were retained for further consideration

- mean_annual_temp had a vif value = 13.2, terhefore removed
- then vif values <3.9


DROPPED SOIL adn SEISMIC becuase was problematic for fitting models
  
- fit combination models
  - remove seismic line and soil parent material form all models because models sometimes failed to 
    converge
  - dropped distance to mine; covariate said selection for mines, which is unlikely

- top model (AIC*~w~* = 1.000) included all covariates 
- the effects of enduring featrues were relatively weak, standardized coefficient values realtively 
  small (\beta  < 0.07), but signfciant; selected flatter areas, further from watercourses and lakes
- selected for pacthes near cutblocks of all ages, but partcilarlyl 5 to 9 years old (\beta =  
  -0.267) 
- selected patches further from paved (\beta = 0.020) and resource (\beta = 0.062) roads, but not 
  statistically signifcant for paved roads (*p-value* = 0.170)
- avoided patches near pipelines (\beta = 0.108) 
- selected for 1 to 5 year old (\beta = 0.068) beetle killed stands; but avoided 6 to 9 year 
  beetle killed old stands (\beta = -0.201) 
- avoided all burn age classes (\beta = -0.019 to -0.253), but weak (\beta = -0.019) and not 
  statistically significant (*p-value* = 0.344) for over 25 years old burns
- selected patches that had deeper winter snow (\beta = 0.310), higher summer precipitation (\beta = 
  0.091) and higher summer temperature (\beta = 0.082)
- selected BWBSmw (\beta = 0.018) compared to BWBSmk, but not statistically significant (*p-value* = 
  0.639)
- strongly selected for treed bog (\beta = 0.583), other (\beta = 0.342), nutrient poor fen 
  (\beta = 0.493) and conifer swamp (\beta = 0.329) wetland types relative to upland conifer 
- selected for nutrient rich fen (\beta = 0.193) relative to upland conifer
- strongly avoided upland deciduous (\beta = -0.731) relative to upland conifer, and avoided 
  deciduous swamp (\beta = -0.095)
- selected for patches with higher percentage of bryoid cover (\beta = 0.149), shrub crown closure 
  (\beta = 0.135) and herb cover (\beta = 0.073) 
- selected for pacthes with older  (\beta = 0.112), but shorter (\beta = -0.131) and closed (\beta = 
  0.140) forest stands
- in genreal, in summer there is was a mix of avoidance of 'productive' areas (i.e., riparian areas, 
  deciduous wetland cover types, burned areas), but greater use of areas near younger cutblocks and 
  warmer, wetter areas, so a bit conflicting in terms of forage and predation risk; 
- interestingly, a lag effect of snow?, where caribou selected areas in summer that had deeper snow 
  in winter; unclear what the mechanism behind this might be, but these may be low predation risk 
  year-round?

![](plots/corr_veg_du8_ew.png)

- vif values for BEC type, landcover class and primary tree species class very high (>38) when all in   model, or in pairs; can only include one; decided to use BEC because of precednece in lietraure adn   link to climate

- top vegetation model included all covariates (BEC type, shrub closure, bryoid cover, herb cover, forest stand age,crown closure and site index) and had an AIC weight (AIC*~w~*) of 1.0

###### Combination Models
- correlations
  - annual precipitation as snow and winter precipitation as snow highly correlated ($\rho$ = 0.91)
  - annual precipitation as snow and average winter temperature highly correlated ($\rho$ = 0.86)
  
  - removed annual ppt as snow

![](plots/corr_winter_climate_du8_ew.png)

- very high vif values for BEC type (207), elevation (29), distance to mines (12) and distance to pipelines (12), therefore removed all of these from analysis


- the top DU8 early winter model included all covariates adn had an AIC*~w~* = 1.00
- however, covariates in the model produced some results not consistent with the literature, i.e., 
  selection of younger stands, low slopes, low snow areas and selection of areas near paved roads 
  (but avoid resoruce roads)
  - needed to re-structure the model to address these issues
  - to do this I:
    - removed distance to paved road
    - replaced all enduring feature (slope, elevation and disatnce to watercoure), vegetation (age, 
      site index, crown closure) and climate (preciptation as snow and temperature) covariates with 
      BEC zone; appeared to be the source of much of the variance inflation (VIF of BEC went from 207       to 9); essentially BEC confounded with all these things, so used BEC to simplify model
    - this 'sparse' model captures cliamet and site characteristics that imapct forest, and then 
      disturbances seperately
      - comarped this to simpler models (i.e., combiantions of BEC, human distrabnce, natural 
        disturabnce, and food covariates) using AIC
      - the top 'simpler' DU8 early winter model included all covariates and had an AIC*~w~* = 1.00







- top model  included all covariates 
- the efefcts of endurign featrues were generally weak, standardized coefficient values (\beta)   
  approximately   0.02)
- selected for pacthes near cutblocks, but order of magnitude stronger selection for ages 5 to 9     
  years (\beta = -0.155) and over 10 years (\beta = -0.103)  comarped to younger cutblocks (\beta = 
  -0.055)
- avoided patches near paved (\beta = 0.037) and resource roads (\beta = 0.029)
- weakly avoided patches near pipelines (\beta = 0.029), but the efefct was not signficant (*p-value* = 0.419)

## Conclusions
In DU6 , 

- visually and statsically cosnsitent with Demars: overlap in defintion of high and low quality   
  habitat pacthes; selected treed bogs and fens; avoid decisuous adn upland types; avoid  lienar 
  features and select early seral/immature forest
- but summer model not as good in validation
  - key differences are changes in use of BEC zone, from BWBSmk in winter to BWBSmw in summer, 
    greater avoidance of lakes in summer, and different climate variables, in particular use of 
    warmer, wetter areas in summer, use of winter deep snow areas in summer (but avoidance of 
    snow in winter)
  - summer climate variables somewhat counter-intuitive adn teh snow variable apepars to be a key 
    factor,but the mechanisms is unclear; may need to be cautious with those variable in the model



- selection of ctublocks may be maladaptive behaviour; cariobu may may selct for distyurbance, but not necessarily 'good' for cariobu if they are kileld there, e.g.,  (https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rspb.2012.1700)
- or, they may also be selectign for 'old' forest, whcih foresters are also selcrting, resutls in overlap, and cariobu are nto adapting to this shift (or unabel to becuase lack of old forest elesewhere)




remember cliamet is for 1990-2010; indicator of a long term trend not actual climatic conditions for a given year
