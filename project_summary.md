## Caribou and Land Use Simulator (CLUS) Decision Support Project Summary

### Goal
Support informed caribou and natural resource management decisions.

### Purpose
Support decision makers by quantifying the predicted resource development costs and caribou conservation benefits of management actions using the best available information.

### General Approach
The CLUS decision support project will capture the complexity of decisions around caribou and natural resource management in quantitative ecological and land use models. The general approach is to create a spatial, forward-looking, caribou population and land use simulator where the landscape characteristics are a central component of the model (Fig. 1).The CLUS model will be designed to capture a relatively high level of detail on landscape dynamics as it is influenced by caribou recovery actions, industrial development and climate change at medium to large scales (i.e., a single or group of caribou herd ranges). Connections will be made in the model between the landscape state and caribou populations via appropriate mechanisms. Therefore, decision can use the CLUS model in planning processes to explore the outcomes of alternative actions and consider the outputs from these models when making caribou recovery decisions. 

The CLUS decision support project is a five year project. It will be implemented initially as a pilot over the first two years of the project through workshop and meetings with discipline experts. Thus, the CLUS project will also be advised by Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development staff and staff from other natural resource ministries, i.e., the Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources (MEMPR) and the BC Oil and Gas Commission (OGC), to develop an approach for simulating future natural resource development (i.e., mining and oil and gas development) in caribou range.
